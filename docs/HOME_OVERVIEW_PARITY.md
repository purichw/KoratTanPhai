# Home Overview v4

> Dated September design/verification record. Later forecast-only, source
> cleanup, CMS and theme changes supersede older data panels and colors below.
> Use [APP_MAP](APP_MAP.md), [SHARED_COMPONENTS](SHARED_COMPONENTS.md) and
> [DESIGN_SYSTEM](DESIGN_SYSTEM.md) for the maintained UI contract.

## Scope And Evidence

Local implementation of `/`, following the two Homepage Live Overview Interaction
v4 documents and three PNGs supplied on 2026-09-05. Earlier Live Overview ZIPs
are not authoritative. Image-only visual reference with written interaction
requirements; no executable prototype, CSS viewport, DPR or browser zoom supplied.
No commit, push or deployment in this task.

- `Korat_Tan_Phai_Homepage_Live_Overview_Interaction_SPEC_v4 (1).md`
- `ChatGPT Image Sep 5, 2026, 01_51_48 PM (1).png`: desktop, 1586x992.
- `ChatGPT Image Sep 5, 2026, 01_51_48 PM (2).png`: tablet-like, 1448x1086,
  including simulated OS chrome which is not product UI.
- `ChatGPT Image Sep 5, 2026, 01_51_49 PM (3).png`: mobile, 863x1822,
  content approximately x=77..785. CSS width unknown; adapt at 390px.

All supplied text and images inspected before edits. Baseline screenshots:
`tmp-snapshots/home-v4-before-1bg388`, local development source including the
previous drought task's uncommitted changes. Desktop page height 1476px at
1586x992; mobile 2399px at 390x844.

## Component / Decision Ledger

2026-09-05 follow-up: the user requested deletion of synthetic Korat agriculture
records and hiding their metrics/panels while retaining component design.
The situation strip now shows forecast status and crop only, and the support
row contains readiness and archive navigation. Agriculture markup and CSS remain
available behind a REAL-only source gate; earlier agriculture screenshots below
are historical evidence, not the current accepted visible data contract.

| Surface | Decision / Ownership | Verification |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Shell / identity | Adopt compact reference proportions, retain existing logo, Google Sans, account and navigation | Desktop/tablet/mobile captures, menu and account checks |
| Filters | Extend existing OperationalFilters with an opt-in compact variant; AppSelect, fixed drought/rice and T+1, mobile edit sheet | Month/district, reload, Escape/focus, wheel isolation |
| Situation strip | Read-only MetricGrid with real forecast status and separately identified agriculture context | No navigation controls, no invented live timestamp/confidence |
| Map + situation panel | Existing shared local SVG, real counts and 3 high-risk items, equal-height desktop frame | Geometry, pan/zoom/selection, no forced navigation, counts |
| All high-risk areas | In-place disclosure retaining every area link, sorted by existing administrative code | Expand/collapse, last item reachable, no navigation on expansion |
| Agriculture | Existing MetricGrid facts with optional expandable details | Values/provenance unchanged, no false district breakdown |
| Readiness | Existing calculation/gauge with headline and expandable breakdown/map action | Readiness never interpreted as severity, same map with explicit return |
| Archive | Compact real link to `/drought`; scoped detail link retains selected target/T+1 | Navigation and archive lazy loading |
| Sources / limitations | Footer disclosure removed by user request across all pages | Inline provenance and forecast caveats remain |

Visual anchor measurements from image 1 (approximate image pixels): sidebar213;
main x238; filter y111/h65; situation y190/h87; map+panel y291/h463;
map width815 and panel width498; bottom support y768/h167. These are provisional
calibration landmarks, not recovered CSS. Tolerances: desktop map/panel top and
bottom within2px; main landmarks within~30px where real content permits; no
horizontal page/KPI overflow; controls and selected features inside map bounds.

## Preserved Contracts / Exceptions

- Home still uses the lightweight T+1 archive, not the full T+1-T+6 download.
  Real archive target/issue month replaces invented live date/time. Archived
  model output is not a current situation report or official warning.
- Exact risk semantics remain 0/1/2/null; missing joined records stay distinct.
  Keep real geography, source provenance and high-risk names instead of image
  examples. No ThaiWater restoration.
- Agricultural rai/confidence are a separate province dataset with its own month
  and provenance, not derived from the forecast or fabricated for a district.
- Mobile screenshot and existing product put counts before map; use that
  observable order. The document's map-first order is a preferred flow, not a
  requirement to discard the supplied mobile arrangement.
- Rice/drought and T+1 are honest fixed context, not fake selectable menus.
  Preserve editable target/district and the shared mobile filter sheet.
- Reference card framing is translated to restrained full-width bands/unframed
  sections; individual metrics and operational map remain framed.
- Written v4 default-readiness headline takes precedence over the images' open
  breakdown. The four unchanged categories are available on expansion. Keep
  their provenance visible even while collapsed.
- Mobile uses readable type and touch targets rather than shrinking the entire
  screenshot to 390px. This increases document height relative to a uniform
  scaling of the framed bitmap; no exact pixel/DPR equivalence is claimed.
- The scale is approximate east-west distance at the visible map center,
  calculated from the existing projection and zoom, not a fixed decorative ruler.
- Unseen hover/focus/loading/error/expanded behavior is product-owned, not
  inferred as no-op. Reference privacy/contact links have no established product
  destinations and are not fabricated.

## Verification / Acceptance Status

Implemented and locally verified on 2026-09-05. No commit, push or deployment.
Current protected build: `tmp-snapshots/home-v4-verified-build`.
Build index SHA-256:
`bfee98193ad4d52ea3718d9d2ce3b524dd5a6130d2e989e0be2e9060c21a3bd1`.
Current screenshots and `metrics.json`: `tmp-snapshots/home-v4-accepted-3eatug`.

Capture conditions: Chromium 151.0.7922.34, DPR1, reduced motion, demo user
`pointy`, target2025-12/T+1, default province scope, forecast map, no selected
area, page at scrollY0. Google Sans and logo loaded in all five viewports.
No page errors, HTTP4xx/5xx responses or horizontal page overflow recorded.
All four summary values measured centered at each viewport.

| Viewport | Current page height | Prior page height | Evidence |
| --- | ---: | ---: | --- |
| Desktop 1586x992 | 1002px | 1476px | `desktop.png`, `comparison-desktop.png` |
| Reference tablet 1448x1086 | 1086px | Not captured | `tablet-reference.png`, `comparison-tablet.png` |
| Landscape tablet 1024x768 | 1194px | Not captured | `tablet-landscape.png` |
| Portrait tablet 768x1024 | 1206px | Not captured | `tablet-portrait.png` |
| Mobile 390x844 | 1799px | 2399px | `mobile.png`, `comparison-mobile.png` |

Measured desktop landmarks: main x230; filters y111.97/h68.48; situation
y192.45/h86; map y290.45/h472/w819.33; side panel w502.66 with the same top and
bottom as the map; support y774.45/h164. These satisfy the calibrated tolerance,
without claiming pixel-exact reproduction of the raster images.

Comparison sheets contain full-page coverage. Desktop columns uniformly scale
to530px and tablet columns to660px. Mobile reference is cropped in image space
to x77..785/y0..1822 and uniformly scaled to390px; before/development use an
actual390px CSS viewport. Reference originals remain untouched. Unknown source
DPR and intentional readable mobile sizing mean these are visual comparisons,
not pixel-difference assertions.

Expanded agriculture/readiness, readiness-map mode, fullscreen and the mobile
filter sheet have separate captures in the same directory. Fullscreen entered
and exited successfully, with a992px SVG filling the viewport. In-place
disclosures retain the URL; selecting readiness reuses the existing SVG map and
provides an explicit return to the forecast layer.

Checks:
- `npm test`: all63 unit/data tests passed across8 files.
- Protected build: TypeScript, Vite, exposure checks, bundle references/budgets
  and canonical archive byte identity passed. Startup107,787gzip bytes; total
  JavaScript2,979,998bytes /328,384gzip bytes. Existing large-chunk warning remains.
- Full protected-build E2E run:53 passed,3 failed,6 configured skips. The failures
  were obsolete assertions for editable hazard/crop and a mobile hydration race
  in test setup; the relevant tests now assert fixed context and wait for the
  filter band. Product selectors and canonical count expectations remain tested.
- Final protected-build focused rerun:25 passed,1 configured skip, covering Home,
  overview loading/failure/retry, custom-dropdown keyboard/wheel behavior and
  province/district/subdistrict drilldown. All56 active scenarios passed across
  the full run and focused rerun, not in a single final full-suite run.
- Six configured skips comprise five existing environment/legacy cases and one
  desktop skip for the mobile-only filter-sheet scenario.

No observed blocker remains in the checked surfaces. Real Safari, production,
new network benchmarks and another full-suite repetition were intentionally
skipped after the highest-risk shared interactions passed. These local results
do not imply a deployment or proof of browser behavior outside Chromium.
