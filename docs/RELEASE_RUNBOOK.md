# Korat Tan Phai / โคราชทันภัย Release Runbook

## Permission Guardrail

Do not commit, push, deploy, migrate, or touch production data unless the current
user task explicitly instructs it.

When authorized, release from a scoped worktree under `/Users/point/korattanphai`.
Preserve the current production revision before building a release candidate.

## Forecast-Only Release Scope

The owner parked Actual routing on 2026-09-20. Follow
[FORECAST_ONLY_RESTORATION.md](FORECAST_ONLY_RESTORATION.md) and the latest
[handoff](HANDOFF.md). The older Actual separation notes are historical, not a
requirement to reactivate that experience.

- Require the protected build, exposure and unchanged bundle-budget gates.
- Test bare routes, old source-T/horizon links and explicit archive links at
  province/district/tambon levels. No live route calls the operational clock.
- Verify month/horizon synchronization, search/bookmarks, missing-origin recovery,
  retained graph/export/map fixes and Supabase revision revalidation.
- Use an isolated tracked-source candidate with production configuration.
  All required CI jobs and authenticated read-only candidate smoke must pass
  before promotion; then verify the production alias.
- Verify both build flags explicitly: `VITE_DATA_BACKEND=supabase` and
  `VITE_REFERENCE_BACKEND=cms`. A pulled empty flag must not silently revert
  the deployed CMS read path. Require the hosted `reference-backend.json`
  marker to report `{"backend":"cms","fallback":false}` and verify CMS
  geometry reads before promotion.
- Keep Actual code/contracts parked. Future activation needs corrected owner
  requirements, approved sources and adapter/UAT evidence.
- No migration, ACL changes, iOS setup or unrelated UAT/research files are included.

## Local Checks

For CI scope, runner-time evidence, required check semantics, and delay
checkpoints, see [ACTIONS_USAGE.md](ACTIONS_USAGE.md). Keep push acceptance,
Quality Gate, deployment build, candidate smoke, and production promotion as
separate recorded results for the intended SHA. A skipped or pending required
job is not a pass outside the verified documentation-only mode.

Inspect scope:

```bash
git status --short
git diff --stat
git diff --check
```

Install dependencies if needed:

```bash
npm install
```

Build:

```bash
npm run build
npm run build:protected
```

Unit/data tests:

```bash
npm test
```

E2E smoke:

```bash
# Codex: start this in an outside-sandbox terminal first
npm run dev:e2e

# Codex: run this outside the sandbox too
npm run test:e2e:attached
```

Local restrictions depend on the current host. When the runtime guard reports
blocked port binding or browser launch, use the supported outside-sandbox path
above. When local execution is available, `npm run test:e2e:managed` starts Vite
automatically; attached mode reuses an explicitly selected existing server.
Do not assume all Codex sessions have the same sandbox profile.

The `dev`, `preview`, and `test:e2e*` npm scripts include local-runtime
preflight guards. If a command is accidentally run inside the Codex sandbox,
the guard should print the required outside-sandbox command instead of a raw
`listen EPERM` or Chromium Mach port stack trace.

Known non-fatal warning:

- Vite may report a large Excel/export chunk. Database-mode builds must not
  bundle raw canonical forecast assets. An advisory is separate from a failing
  exposure or protected bundle gate, which remains a release blocker.

Production builds:

- Vercel uses `npm run build:protected` from `vercel.json`.
- `build:protected` runs the normal TypeScript/Vite build, obfuscates generated
  JavaScript assets in `dist`, rewrites the final asset hash, and runs the
  production exposure and bundle-budget checks. A failing gate blocks release.

## Production Deploy

Build a production-configured candidate without moving the production alias:

```bash
vercel --prod --skip-domain --yes \
  --build-env VITE_DATA_BACKEND=supabase \
  --build-env VITE_REFERENCE_BACKEND=cms
```

Expected production alias:

- `https://korattanphai.vercel.app`

Vercel project link lives locally in `.vercel/project.json` and is ignored by
git. After required CI and authenticated read-only candidate smoke pass,
recheck the production revision and promote this exact deployment with
`vercel promote <candidate-url> --yes`.

## Production Smoke Checks

After deploy:

1. Open `https://korattanphai.vercel.app`.
2. Log in with an admin-provisioned Supabase email/password account; follow
   `docs/AUTH_SETUP.md`. Do not use test-only fake build values for deployments.
3. Confirm Thai-only visible UI and Korat Tan Phai / โคราชทันภัย brand title.
4. Confirm no console errors and no failed network requests.
5. Confirm the visitor sidebar shows `ภาพรวม`, its `ภัยแล้ง` subitem and
   database-mode `ส่งออก Excel`. In `/admin`, confirm the separate sidebar shows
   only `จัดการข้อมูล`, `รายการนำเข้าและฉบับร่าง` and `นำเข้าข้อมูล`, with all
   destinations under `/admin`. Visitor search, bookmarks and export must not
   appear in the Admin shell. Verify the Admin drawer on mobile as well.
6. Confirm the authenticated CMS geometry bundle supplies the province boundary,
   district boundaries and 289 subdistrict boundaries. No retired country-context
   layer or static-file fallback is expected in the protected deployment.
7. Confirm `/api/health` returns the process-health response with `no-store`.
8. Confirm retired research/source/station resources are absent from the active
   Admin catalog, while original files and history remain readable.
9. Confirm the API functions include `admin_hierarchy.json`, used by the real
   district/subdistrict catalog, in their deployment bundles.
10. Check desktop and mobile widths for no horizontal overflow.
11. Confirm `/`, `/drought`, `/wang-nam-khiao`, and
    `/wang-nam-khiao/t-302504` load after login.
12. Confirm legacy `/nakhon-ratchasima/...` URLs still load for old links.
13. Confirm `/wang-nam-khiao/t-302504` does not show station, rainfall,
    water-level, reservoir, or irrigation detail panels.
14. Confirm forecast values and missing values follow the published rev03
    data on province, district and subdistrict routes; missing values must not
    render as normal/low-risk.
15. Confirm forecast source-month/horizon labels and provenance remain readable,
    and desktop/mobile zoom reveals district and subdistrict map labels.
16. Confirm the root province overview does not show a `กลับแผนที่ประเทศ`
    route-back button.
17. Confirm timestamp/timezone wording remains visible where shown.
18. Confirm public-safety copy does not imply guaranteed outcomes.

Useful Playwright production smoke pattern:

```bash
node -e '/* use Playwright chromium to open production URL, inspect console, and screenshot key pages */'
```

Keep generated screenshots outside git unless intentionally documenting a visual
baseline.

## Rollback / Recovery

For an owner-authorized source revert, inspect the exact commit and preserve
unrelated work, create a new revert commit, then follow the same scoped checks,
exact-SHA CI, production-configured candidate and smoke/promotion sequence above.
Do not bypass candidate verification with a direct production alias deployment.

Alternatively, when rollback is explicitly authorized, inspect and promote the
recorded previous good deployment. First check its backend flags and database
compatibility; rolling back a frontend does not reverse a CMS migration or
published data. Recovery targets belong to their dated HANDOFF checkpoints,
not a permanently hardcoded deployment in this runbook.

After rollback:

- Smoke `https://korattanphai.vercel.app`.
- Confirm map loads.
- Confirm root `/` and local drill-down routes load.
- Document the rollback in `docs/HANDOFF.md`.

## Required Approval Gates

Commit:

- User has asked for commit or release.
- Scope is intentional.
- Checks pass or failures are disclosed.

Push:

- User has asked for push or release.
- Branch is known.
- No unrelated local work is staged.

Production deploy:

- User has asked for deploy.
- Normal build, protected build, tests, and e2e have passed.
- Public-safety copy and provenance are not degraded.
- Production smoke will be run after deploy.

## Docs-Only Changes

Push documentation normally when publishing is authorized; do not add
`[skip ci]`. Quality Gate has an explicit docs mode for allowlisted internal
Markdown after a verified passing exact base. Unknown/runtime paths, manual
dispatch, missing history, and missing baseline evidence run the full gate.
The final `regression` check remains present in both modes. See
[ACTIONS_USAGE.md](ACTIONS_USAGE.md) for its conditions and estimated savings.

For docs-only work:

```bash
git status --short
git diff --check
```

Run build/tests only if docs affect published runtime behavior or executable
snippets.
