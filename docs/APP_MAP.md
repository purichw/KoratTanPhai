# Korat Tan Phai / โคราชทันภัย App Map

## Routing Model

FACT: The app is served by Vite/Vercel as a React single-page app with
client-side route handling in `src/App.tsx`. In this Nakhon Ratchasima-only
subset, `/` opens the local province workspace after login. Navigation exposes
`ภาพรวม`, its `ภัยแล้ง` subitem and `ส่งออก Excel` in database mode.

Routes:

- `/login`: Supabase Email + Password; internal-only return paths preserve query/hash.
- `/`: province-level Nakhon Ratchasima overview.
- `/drought`: province-level drought context page.
- `/{district-slug}`: district-level drill-down.
- `/{district-slug}/{subdistrict-slug}`: subdistrict-level drill-down.
- `/nakhon-ratchasima/...`: legacy alias accepted for old links.

Other province placeholder routes are not part of this subset's primary
navigation.

Forecast-only restoration, 2026-09-20; see [release evidence](HANDOFF.md):

- `NakhonRatchasimaWorkspace` always mounts the existing forecast workspace.
- Bare `target=T&horizon=h` and explicit `mapLayer=forecast-archive` links have
  the same origin/horizon meaning. They are never converted to an actual month.
- No selection uses the latest published origin and T+1. Retired `period` is
  ignored and removed when the forecast selection is written.
- Home's compact overview is T+1; T+2..T+6 use the full forecast workspace,
  preserving district scope when supplied. Invalid/missing selections do not default.
- `OperationalDroughtWorkspace` and the Actual/Archive switch are parked.
  The forecast product does not depend on `/api/operational-context`.
  See [restoration contract](FORECAST_ONLY_RESTORATION.md).

## User-Facing Surfaces

Primary user-facing surface:

- Global search: `WorkspaceSearch` opens a
  shared dialog from the top-right desktop/mobile toolbar on Visitor routes.
  Its trigger shares alignment with bookmarks. Account controls live at the
  bottom of the sidebar; Admin has its own navigation without Visitor search.
  It finds repeated names across province/district/tambon levels and active tools,
  with aliases, topics, filters and clearable per-account browser history.
  See [Search behavior](SEARCH_BEHAVIOR.md). Existing scoped map search remains available.

- `NakhonRatchasimaWorkspace`: province -> district -> subdistrict operational
  drill-down for canonical province `TH-P29`, with 32 districts and 289
  subdistricts. Map coloring switches between archived forecast risk and workbook
  irrigation status. Catalog entries for other data families are
  not evidence of active map layers.
- Forecast pages at province, district, and subdistrict level include the shared
  source-backed forecast archive experience: origin/base month T selection, one T+
  horizon selector, archive summary metrics, shared map filters, the local
  Nakhon map and source/limitation wording. Province/district pages have a
  six-month percent/count bar graph; a tambon page shows its own forecast status,
  not a multi-tambon aggregate. Supabase supplies scoped rev03 data using the
  same semantics across all geography levels.
- Archive Home is a compact T+1 overview with district filtering, risk counts and links
  to high-risk tambons. Agriculture panels require real source records and are
  currently hidden; cleared research panels are not restored as placeholder data.
- `ForecastExcelExport` opens a filtered workbook dialog. It includes all six
  horizons, district/tambon sheets, formula-driven analysis, chart, PivotTable,
  typed data/dictionary and optional same-target comparison across origin rounds.
  See `FORECAST_EXCEL_EXPORT.md` for limits; it is not an online general BI tool.

Inherited nationwide/workflow demo sections were removed in the October cleanup.
Retained parked Actual contracts do not establish active routes or source feeds.

Database mode adds a shared bookmark control in the desktop/mobile account
toolbar, not a new route. Its modal lists followed areas and saved filters for
the authenticated user. Following an area is independent of forecast criteria;
named forecast filters require a valid origin selection, including plain legacy URLs. Restoring a forecast
filter preserves source month T, horizon,
area, map risk and irrigation, including restoration on the same pathname. Existing and new
links/saved filters keep the same source-row values; legacy `target` query and
saved `target_period` keys still identify T, with forward dates derived at runtime.

## Admin / Internal Routes

`/admin` is the CMS workspace; `/admin?draft=...` restores a saved draft.
`/admin/login` uses the same Auth accounts as `/login` but an independent
session. A visitor login alone does not open the CMS. Scope transitions reload
the document, and logout synchronizes only tabs in the same scope.

Admin navigation offers `จัดการข้อมูล` (`/admin`), `รายการนำเข้าและฉบับร่าง`
(`?view=imports`) and `นำเข้าข้อมูล` (`?view=upload`, the existing import dialog).
Closing import returns to the draft list; saving opens the created draft. Unsaved
edits still block navigation until saved or explicitly discarded. Reload and
browser history preserve the selected Admin destination. No Admin navigation or
toolbar opens visitor overview, drought, export, bookmarks or geographic search.
Visitor routes keep their existing navigation. API access additionally requires
server-verified `ktp_cms_operators` membership. Simulated personas have been
removed. See [ADMIN_CMS.md](ADMIN_CMS.md) for workflows/limitations
and [CMS_CUTOVER_20260928.md](CMS_CUTOVER_20260928.md) for activation status.

## Hidden / Legacy / Compatibility Routes

FACT: `/nakhon-ratchasima`, `/nakhon-ratchasima/{district-slug}`, and
`/nakhon-ratchasima/{district-slug}/{subdistrict-slug}` remain supported as
legacy aliases so old Kaset Tan Phai links do not break.

## Indexing / Noindex Behavior

FACT:

- `index.html` does not currently include a `robots` noindex directive.
- There is no `robots.txt` in `public/`.
- There is no route-specific metadata system.

needs audit:

- Confirm whether `https://korattanphai.vercel.app` should be publicly indexed
  while it is a prototype.
- Add `robots.txt` or metadata only after that decision.

## Navigation Contracts

- Sidebar/nav exposes overview, drought and database-only Excel export.
- Visible UI is Thai-only; there is no language switch in the product surface.
- Account actions use the real Auth session; the persona/reset-demo menu was removed.
- Login redirects unauthenticated direct links to `/login`, then returns to the
  requested path after successful Supabase email/password authentication.
- Opening `/` shows the rev03 overview; the local workspace owns origin, area,
  horizon and forecast-status filters.
- Forecast controls select origin month and area. The page horizon dropdown and
  horizon strip share state; the map month selector stays synchronized. Hazard `ภัยแล้ง`
  and crop `ข้าว` are fixed context, not working multi-hazard/multi-crop selectors.
  Province chooses districts; district/tambon views choose tambons in that district.
  Map controls also filter risk and irrigation, with an independent color mode.
- Drought archive controls use source/base month T + T+ horizon as the primary
  navigation state, following the user's 2026-09-06 confirmation that source
  rows are forecast origins. Changing T+ preserves T and changes the actual
  target month to T+horizon. The original rev03 baseline spans June 2015-December
  2025; current selectable origins come from published metadata, including
  approved new CMS rounds. For
  December 2025, T+1-T+6 target January-June 2026. A no-data/out-of-scope archive
  combination must remain visibly distinct from no-risk.
- Nakhon Ratchasima route slugs are navigation-only. Data joins must use admin
  codes.
- Rainfall helpers remain parked. Any future reactivation must distinguish
  nearest-station context from a direct local gauge reading.
- Legacy `/nakhon-ratchasima/...` links may load directly, but in-app route
  actions should generate the shorter Nakhon Ratchasima-only paths.

## Screens / Components By Surface

- Login/history: `src/App.tsx`; authenticated shell: `src/AuthenticatedApp.tsx`.
- Parked Actual composition: `src/components/nakhon-ratchasima/OperationalDroughtWorkspace.tsx` (not mounted).
- Archive Home: `src/components/nakhon-ratchasima/ProvinceForecastOverview.tsx`.
- Shared drought layout: `src/components/nakhon-ratchasima/DroughtForecastWorkspace.tsx`.
- Shared controls: `ForecastControls.tsx` and `DroughtOperationalWorkspace.tsx`
  in the same directory; graph: `ForecastRiskBarGraph.tsx`; map:
  `NakhonRatchasimaLocalMap.tsx`.
- Excel dialog: `src/components/ForecastExcelExport.tsx`; saved-workspace dialog:
  `src/components/WorkspaceBookmarks.tsx`.
- Nakhon Ratchasima workspace: `NakhonRatchasimaWorkspace` in
  `src/components/NakhonRatchasimaWorkspace.tsx`.
- Admin entry: `src/admin/AdminWorkspace.tsx`; navigation: `AdminNavigation.tsx`;
  area catalogue/map: `AreaWorkspace.tsx` and `AreaBoundaryMap.tsx`; forecast
  readiness/new-round/recovery: `ForecastLifecycle.tsx`; private import resume:
  `ImportWorkList.tsx` and `useImportAutosave.ts`.
- Shared startup: `AppStartup.tsx`, `PageLoadBoundary.tsx`, `src/startupMotion.ts`
  and pre-JS `index.html`. Blocking reads expose the ready result or existing
  error UI after actual milestones settle. See [LOADING_SCREEN](LOADING_SCREEN.md).

## Do Not Regress

- Thai labels must remain complete for all primary controls.
- Do not reintroduce an EN web version unless the product owner explicitly asks
  for it.
- Mobile navigation must avoid horizontal overflow.
- Map controls must remain keyboard reachable.
- Page sections must be reachable without relying on hover-only behavior.
- Nakhon Ratchasima unseeded subdistricts must show an explicit no-data state,
  not a normal/green state.
- Rainfall station coverage must not hide the no-data rule for local evidence:
  a subdistrict can have a nearest station and still have no local impact
  evidence.
- Forecast archive blank cells mean out of scope, not no-risk. Missing joined
  archive records are separate source/join problems and must not render as
  green, normal, or complete.
- Public/resident alert copy must remain action-oriented and low-jargon.
