# โคราชทันภัย Operations

Current-scope review: **2026-11-04**; NFR activation evidence below is dated
2026-09-09, not a new live probe. Start with the [NFR operations runbook](NFR_OPERATIONS_RUNBOOK.md)
for checks, incidents, job replay, backup/restore and activation. Acceptance
targets and owner roles live in [NON_FUNCTIONAL_REQUIREMENTS.md](NON_FUNCTIONAL_REQUIREMENTS.md).

## Current Operations Model

Supabase login, published forecast reads, saved workspaces and the independently
authenticated CMS have real persistence. The legacy advisory/persona/delivery
workflows below are historical demo descriptions removed from runtime.
Current operator work is import/repair, reviewed downloads, new forecast rounds,
data readiness, saved work and recovery into a new draft. See
[ADMIN_CMS](ADMIN_CMS.md) and [CMS_FORECAST_LIFECYCLE](CMS_FORECAST_LIFECYCLE.md).

The NFR handlers were deployed to [production](https://korattanphai.vercel.app)
on 2026-09-09. Public health returns 200; model-input ingestion and private
readiness remain unconfigured (503); telemetry POST returns 204 while disabled.
The collector and resumable job/backup/restore tools remain operator-run.
See [release evidence](HANDOFF.md) and [API setup](API.md#model-inputs-local-system-bridge).
That NFR release activated no remote migration, actual local/ThaiWater feed,
provider dashboard, scheduler, monitoring, notification recipient or remote log
store. Prepared NFR migrations and environment settings still need operator
activation. V2 remains proposed.
This NFR limit does not negate the separately completed forecast/CMS migrations
recorded in HANDOFF; do not replay migrations without checking the target ledger.

## Actual NFR Ownership / ผู้รับผิดชอบงานระบบจริง

These are roles to assign, separate from the simulated personas below.

| Role | ความรับผิดชอบ / Responsibility | Operational evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Platform operator | ระบบเปิดได้ โควตา log และการแจ้งเหตุ / Availability, quotas, logs and escalation wiring. | Monitor run + dependency check + tested recipient. |
| Integration operator | เก็บและส่งข้อมูลซ้ำอย่างถูกต้อง / Collector cadence, frozen job replay and retained evidence. | Run ID, input hash and verified API receipt. |
| Data steward | รับรองนิยามเวลา หน่วย พื้นที่ และคุณภาพ / Approve source timing, units, geography and quality policy. | Versioned source agreement and freshness thresholds. |
| Model lead | ตัดสินความพร้อมของ input และรับผิดชอบผลโมเดล / Feature readiness and team-operated model output. | Frozen input manifest and model validation; V2 is still a design. |
| Database operator | สำรองและซ้อมกู้ทั้งฐานข้อมูลและไฟล์ / Full database/asset backup and isolated restore. | Restore report with actual coverage and measured recovery time. |
| Release/QA owner | รับหลักฐาน regression และควบคุมการปล่อยรุ่น / Review regression evidence and release controls. | Artifact identity, required CI checks and deployment smoke. |

## Historical Demo Operator Roles

Retired personas from the removed `src/data/canonical/users.json`:

- National agricultural officer
- Provincial agricultural officer
- District agricultural officer
- Agricultural extension officer
- Agricultural / climate analyst
- Water / irrigation authority
- Supervisor / approver
- Farmer

## Historical Demo Workflows

Retired workflow chain (not current CMS publication):

1. Risk event selected.
2. Field task submitted.
3. Advisory submitted for review.
4. Supervisor approves or requests changes.
5. Approved advisory is published.
6. Delivery demo records and farmer alert are created.

Key IDs:

- `ARE-2026-0825-NE`
- `FV-0825-NE-01`
- `ADV-2026-824`
- `FARM-001`

## Source Freshness Operations

Current facts:

- A JSON/CSV collector, input API and one-shot resumable job wrapper exist; no
  live ingest job is scheduled.
- Job freshness reports separately evaluate observation-window age and fetch
  age. Missing thresholds mean `unknown`; historical mode is explicit.
- This local report is not a dashboard feed or provider availability monitor.
- Historical rainfall station/proxy fixtures were removed from runtime. No live
  rainfall readings or province water-provider snapshots supply the active app.

Operational requirement:

- Track latest successful run, input hash, source observation interval, fetch
  and receipt separately. Rainfall, satellite composite and crop statistics
  require different owner-approved arrival/freshness expectations.
- For rainfall, track station timestamp, accumulation window, unit `mm`, quality
  flag, and whether a value is direct or nearest-station representative context.
- Show stale banners when data exceeds accepted age.
- The model lead must hold live publication when required evidence fails its
  policy. Current input ingestion stores data and reports freshness; it does
  not implement an alert gate or silently downgrade hazard severity.
- Keep source timestamps separate from publication timestamps.

## Admin Audit

Current facts:

- Current CMS revisions/publications keep server-side actor/reason/history and
  immutable originals. Private import checkpoints enforce owner and revision.
  See the CMS lifecycle contract for retention and recovery boundaries.
- The former resettable frontend demo audit was a fixture, not the current CMS
  audit system, and is no longer active.
- Server completion logs and local ingest manifests are operational evidence;
  they are not append-only business approval/publication audit records.

Operational requirement:

- Use append-only server audit for verification, edit, approval, change request,
  publication, rollback, and cancellation.
- Include actor, role, jurisdiction, timestamp, before/after summary, and reason.

## Incident / Alert Operations

For website/dependency incidents use the NFR runbook severity, owner and
escalation steps. A passing liveness response only proves that the handler ran.
Private readiness checks one published archive metadata record; it does not
prove all rows, RLS user paths, current source freshness or forecast quality.

The opt-in repository monitor can fail a run and retain a sanitized report.
GitHub notification settings, recipient assignment and channel failover need
configuration and a delivery drill. No email, Slack or SMS incident delivery is
claimed by this implementation.

Before real public operations:

- Define alert owner.
- Define approval authority.
- Define escalation path.
- Define cancellation/correction path.
- Define how false positives and false negatives are reviewed.
- Define channel failover.

## Scheduled Jobs

No collector is scheduled automatically. Run `npm run model-inputs:demo` for a
synthetic local end-to-end check. For unattended operation use
`scripts/run-model-input-job.mjs` with a private persistent `--state-dir`, a
confirmed source config and freshness policy. The team's scheduler invokes
one run at the agreed cadence and observes the exit code. Failed submission
can resume using `--resume RUN_ID`; collection failure requires a new run because
there is no frozen batch yet. Full arguments and recovery rules are in the
[runbook](NFR_OPERATIONS_RUNBOOK.md#input-jobs-and-replay).

The job wrapper runs on one persistent worker host. It is not a Vercel `/tmp`
queue or a distributed scheduler. Never discard a pending batch because a POST
timed out; the receiver may already have persisted it.

needs audit:

- Data ingest cadence.
- Model refresh cadence.
- Alert expiry/archival job.
- Delivery retry job.
- Dashboard aggregation job.
- Source publication lag, independent raw-evidence retention, backup retention
  destination and quota budget for batch exports.

## Safe Production Work

- Do not deploy without explicit current-user instruction.
- Do not touch production data unless explicitly instructed.
- Run [RELEASE_RUNBOOK.md](RELEASE_RUNBOOK.md) before deploy.
- For public-safety wording, require human review before operational release.
- Record production smoke results in handoff notes when relevant.
