# Forecast Archive And Saved Workspaces

> Historical initial database migration. The rev02 dataset/counts and earlier
> date labels below are not the current source authority. The later
> [rev03 cutover](DROUGHT_REV03_CUTOVER.md), [scoped loading](FORECAST_SCOPED_LOADING.md),
> [CMS lifecycle](CMS_FORECAST_LIFECYCLE.md) and [DATA_CONTRACT](DATA_CONTRACT.md)
> define current reads/publication. Do not replay the retired seed or treat the
> zero-row initial table as current database state.

## Scope

Only the approved rev02 forecast archive and per-account followed areas/saved
filters are in this migration. No ThaiWater, rain observations, synthetic
agricultural metrics, persona permissions or legacy localStorage workflow state
is imported. Geometry and unrelated local context remain in their current files.

## Audited Baseline

Read-only SQL against `dihchjflzhcekywarhxd` on 2026-09-05 confirmed:

| Table | Rows | Access |
| --- | ---: | --- |
| `ktp_districts` | 32 | authenticated SELECT |
| `ktp_subdistricts` | 289 | authenticated SELECT |
| `ktp_forecast_datasets` | 0 | authenticated SELECT of published rows |
| `ktp_forecast_runs` | 0 | authenticated SELECT through published dataset |
| `ktp_forecast_values` | 0 | authenticated SELECT through published dataset |
| `ktp_research_crosswalk` | 0 | no browser grants |

All six have RLS enabled. There are no anon grants on these tables. The
reconstruction in `supabase/baseline/20260905_existing.sql` is for isolated
tests/new environments, NOT a migration to run against the linked database.

## Source Identity

`scripts/lib/forecast-migration.mjs` pins the original workbook, normalized
workbook and canonical artifact SHA-256 values from the prior complete source
audit. A changed workbook/artifact stops the importer and requires a new audit.
There is no arbitrary source URL, provider fallback or score transformation.

- Version: `drought-rev02-9b299cefc704`.
- Dataset ID: `9b299cef-c704-4139-8085-18664253cc80`.
- 289 canonical codes, 127 source months T (`2015-06` through `2025-12`),
  6 horizons, 220,218 vintages.
- Risk 0: 44,474; risk 1: 27,670; risk 2: 22,830; explicit null: 125,244.
- `source_year_month` preserves `Source_YearMonth` verbatim.
- The normalized workbook originally did NOT confirm whether this is issue or
  target month. The published marker
  `source_time_role = UNCONFIRMED_PRODUCT_USES_TARGET` records that provenance
  and the earlier product convention; it remains unchanged.
- Published rows retain the legacy representation: stored `target_period` =
  source month; stored `origin_period` = source month minus horizon. These are
  immutable storage dates, not the current product's displayed dates.
- Crosswalk evidence preserves Source_ID, irrigation metadata, mapping method,
  flags and the known ID 222 correction. Admin codes remain the join keys.
- Manifests store unchanged full/T+1 metadata; actual predictions live only in
  the normalized values table. The security-invoker read RPC reconstructs the
  existing archive shape and obeys table RLS, including unpublished isolation.

## Forward Dates (User Confirmed 2026-09-06)

The user confirmed that `Source_YearMonth` is the origin/base month T for all
127 source months. This supersedes the previous product convention without
rewriting the workbook's original `UNCONFIRMED` provenance. Runtime projection
uses `issueMonth = sourcePeriod` and actual `targetMonth = sourcePeriod + horizon`.
Selectable T remains June 2015-December 2025; targets span July 2015-June 2026.
December 2025 T+1 targets January 2026 and T+6 targets June 2026.

The canonical file, SHA-256 pins, published rows, RPC manifests and their legacy
field names remain unchanged. `targetMonths`, `packedRiskByTargetMonth`, URL
`target` and saved `target_period` continue to key the same source row, paired
with its horizon. Runtime helpers ignore the manifest's backwards-calculated
`issueMonth` for product display. Old and new links/saved filters select the same
values and show the same forward dates. Risk `0`, `1`, `2` and explicit `null`
keep their meanings. This change requires no schema migration, production data
write, import, saved-row rewrite or new canonical hash.

## Import Safety

New SQL is additive. Import creates a draft and resumes idempotently without
overwriting existing records. A duplicate with different values fails the
subsequent digest comparison; it is never silently replaced. Publish locks the
archive tables briefly and checks every prediction via an ordered SHA-256,
all run dates, counts, manifests and crosswalk before changing status atomically.
The importer rejects the wrong linked project. Generated SQL/evidence is under
the ignored `tmp-snapshots/archive-migration-*` directory, without credentials.

```bash
FORECAST_WORKBOOK_DIR=/Users/point/Downloads node scripts/migrate-forecast-archive.mjs check
# After CLI login, linking, schema review and approval to apply the migration:
# supabase db query --linked --file supabase/migrations/20260905110000_archive_and_saved_workspaces.sql
FORECAST_WORKBOOK_DIR=/Users/point/Downloads node scripts/migrate-forecast-archive.mjs import
node scripts/migrate-forecast-archive.mjs verify
FORECAST_WORKBOOK_DIR=/Users/point/Downloads node scripts/migrate-forecast-archive.mjs publish
```

Do not execute commands merely because they appear here. Publishing the
dataset is distinct from enabling a frontend provider or deploying the app.
Prefer `supabase db push --linked` after inspecting its dry run and migration
history. If the SQL Editor/Management API is used instead, record the verified
application with `supabase migration repair --linked --status applied
20260905110000` before a later `db push`; never mark an unapplied schema applied.
No archive metadata, risk values or personal state is writable through an
anonymous client. Browser clients never receive a service key or DB password.

## Saved Data

- `ktp_followed_areas`: owner UUID + canonical province/district/subdistrict
  code. Generated FK columns reject unknown areas. Opening a followed area
  selects that area with the page's latest available source month T.
- `ktp_saved_filters`: explicit name, view, area, dataset ID, source month T
  (stored in the backward-compatible `target_period` field), horizon,
  risk status and irrigation criterion. Migration `20260906010000` adds the
  latter with default `all` and allowed values `all`, `irrigated`, `rainfed`,
  `unknown`; see `IRRIGATION_FILTER.md`. Foreign keys require a real vintage.
  Overview only permits T+1
  and province/district scope. Drought/rice are fixed product context.
- RLS uses `auth.uid() = user_id` for all read/write operations. UUIDs are not
  derived from the display persona or mutable user metadata.
- No arbitrary redirect URLs, auth tokens or legacy demo state are saved.
- Each authenticated provider has isolated, disposable memory. Failed requests
  show errors and retry; they do not silently save to localStorage instead.

## Verification Status

Local runtime wiring is gated by `VITE_DATA_BACKEND=supabase`; default/missing
is `static`, and invalid values fail the build. Supabase mode requires real
browser auth configuration, excludes the two raw forecast JSON assets from
new builds, and has no silent static fallback. The tiny legacy entry summary
and public geometry are unchanged. Older public deployments still contain
their original static assets; this change does not revoke old deployment URLs.

`WorkspaceBookmarks` is composed once per visible desktop/mobile account
toolbar, using the existing shared buttons and compact modal. Saving records
source month T, T+, area, dataset and map risk. `mapRisk` now round-trips through
URLs; restoring a saved item remounts only the route workspace, preserving provider
caches while applying a saved selection even on the same route. Ordinary
navigation/dropdown changes keep their existing lifecycle. Full CI caught and
rejected a broader URL-keyed remount that closed the mobile filter sheet;
the corrected implementation uses a saved-selection-only version counter.

```bash
npm run test:database
npm run test:e2e:database
```

The UI harness runs a separate local Vite server with a fake Supabase host and
source-backed archive responses. Personal records are test-only network
fixtures. It never reaches the real project or saves credentials.

### Historical Migration And Release Evidence

The records below describe the migration/release checks under the earlier
product convention. Month/T+ pairs identify the unchanged source-row keys;
their old date labels do not verify the forward runtime projection confirmed
on 2026-09-06.

Local isolated PostgreSQL/PGlite: all 220,218 values imported and checked;
full and T+1 RPC results deep-equal canonical projections; anonymous reads and
authenticated archive writes denied; two simulated Auth users cannot read,
insert, transfer, update or delete each other's saved records. This does not
yet prove remote PostgREST/RLS, production latency or hosted UI behavior.

Local checks at this checkpoint: 217 unit tests passed; nine isolated database
checks passed; four desktop/mobile database UI scenarios passed, including
same-route saved-filter restoration, reload, confirmed removal, RPC retry and
absence of static archive fallback. The protected database build passed exposure
and bundle checks, including absence of both raw forecast JSON assets.
Fourteen additional desktop/mobile static-provider regression scenarios passed
for Home, province/district/subdistrict filters/maps, area navigation, session
refresh and logout failure. Canonical/generated archive files remain unchanged.
Screenshots: `tmp-snapshots/database-workspaces/desktop-saved-filter.png` and
`mobile-saved-filter.png` (test-only account, canonical forecast data).

Remote schema migration `20260905110000` was applied with `supabase db push`
after its dry run on 2026-09-05. CLI migration history matches the local file.
The existing `target_period` is GENERATED ALWAYS from origin + horizon; the
importer omits it, and the isolated baseline now reproduces that constraint.
The first import stopped before inserting predictions when this distinction
was detected; the corrected importer resumes without overwriting any values.
It batches twelve independently transactional months per CLI request.

Migration `20260905124000` preserves the existing publication/immutability
triggers and adds a target-month branch for the explicitly marked archive.
Origin-based datasets retain the original six-horizons-per-origin requirement.
Target-month archives require six horizons per target, verbatim source months,
289 crosswalks and 289 explicit rows per run. Negative tests reject missing
source months, horizons and rows, and reject edits after publication. No guard
was disabled, no forecast was invented, and no existing value was changed.

The approved dataset is published. Remote ordered prediction SHA-256 is
`9352f69f7e86d1e8c549b03bc0b2e96ad1a46c7f3ef1ffa3bd09afd79175d01b`;
all 220,218 cells, 762 runs, 289 locations and zero temporal errors match source.
Evidence: `tmp-snapshots/archive-migration-eH6Tjy/verification.json`.

`scripts/verify-database-archive.mjs` passed using a real admin-provisioned Auth
account: both complete RPC projections deep-equal canonical source, exactly one
published dataset has the pinned source hashes, and anonymous archive/personal
reads are denied. One observed request took 1,176ms for T+1 and 1,814ms for all
horizons; these are smoke observations, not a latency SLO. Evidence:
`smoke-results/database-integrity/report.json`. The script records no credentials
and never changes predictions or personal records.

Hosted candidate checks verified all 289 map statuses against source on Home
Dec-2025 T+1, province Dec-2025 T+6 and district Jun-2015 T+2 (source-month keys).
Ban Kao Dec-2025 T+4 is high-risk, as in the workbook. Under the current forward
projection its actual target is April 2026. The smoke account saved Ban Kao and a
named test filter, reloaded, and restored Dec-2025/T+4/high-risk on mobile. These two
personal test records remain in that account; they are not prediction data.
Read-only role/claim simulation against those real rows verified owner reads
and cross-owner isolation; no real second account was created.

## Release Smoke Harness

The release smoke harness supports `SMOKE_DATA_BACKEND=supabase`. It compares
actual app RPC responses and all 289 rendered map classes on every tested route,
rejects static fallback, checks saved-workspace reads and captures both viewport
sizes. Optional `SMOKE_SAVED_FILTER_NAME` verifies a known record across fresh
login sessions. Production promotion status is recorded in `HANDOFF.md`.
