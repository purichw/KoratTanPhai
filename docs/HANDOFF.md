the newest release supersedes earlier statements about production state.

## Recent Changes

CMS forecast lifecycle (implemented 2026-10-15, released 2026-10-16):

- Admin can create a new forecast origin through an empty draft or the existing
  normalized Excel/CSV importer, inspect completeness and date coverage, resume
  server-saved import reviews, download the exact original, and recover a prior
  forecast round into a new reviewable draft. Empty cells are insufficient data,
  never risk 0. Explicit validation/publication, immutable history, per-account
  work ownership and separate Visitor/Admin sessions remain enforced.
- Reused the existing Admin shell, metric groups, dialogs, selectors, empty
  states and forecast/API envelope. Existing-origin correction still works;
  recovery preserves other origins. The parked Actual routes remain disabled.
  See [CMS_FORECAST_LIFECYCLE.md](CMS_FORECAST_LIFECYCLE.md) for contracts/limits.
- Pushed only this chat's changes as `0028ebb` and `2d2d7cb` from the isolated
  `.tools/cms-forecast-lifecycle-20261015` worktree. Unrelated primary-checkout
  changes were not staged or overwritten. No native-app changes are included.
- Captured 442,918 original rows in a private 71-part recovery snapshot and
  rehearsed both migrations locally. Applied only `20261015010000` and
  `20261015020000` in one transaction guarded by the prior migration ledger and
  published revision. Post-migration comparison proved every original field
  unchanged. Five reference-resource checks and 18 real PostgREST private-access
  denial checks passed. Post-promotion publication identity is still
  `a3be4448-6c8e-4039-b574-4674e261ee9b`; new private import tables remain empty.
- All seven jobs passed in full [Quality Gate 38869935304](https://github.com/purichw/KoratTanPhai/actions/runs/38869935304)
  on exact `2d2d7cb`. The first run on `0028ebb` failed two built loading cases
  because their route fixture did not answer the new `work-list` read. The fix
  explicitly exercises that loading dependency; no timeout/assertion or auth
  boundary was relaxed, and the second commit changes only tests, smoke and docs.
- Promoted the verified production-configured candidate
  `dpl_DHKiNas9gA1jwBQhXrrWuMf9kcmP`
  (`https://korattanphai-mxq2y8yia-purich-w.vercel.app`). Rechecked the main alias
  against `8b05a25` immediately before promotion and exact `2d2d7cb` afterward.
  Supabase/CMS markers, `fallback: false`, and no-store process health passed.
- Real-account, read-only candidate and production smoke passed: 39 Visitor
  checks plus Admin navigation, grouped areas, templates, readiness/new-round/
  recovery dialogs and saved-work lists on desktop/mobile. Separate auth,
  warm-return behavior, no horizontal overflow and zero application-data writes
  were verified. Actual publication, autosave/reopen/retry and recovery writes
  were tested in isolated browser/database fixtures, not with synthetic live
  forecasts. No physical-iPhone or native Excel rendering certification is made.
- Hosted [Deployment Smoke 38871707192](https://github.com/purichw/KoratTanPhai/actions/runs/38871707192)
  also passed on exact `2d2d7cb` against the promoted production alias, including
  real authentication. CLI promotion did not emit a new GitHub production smoke
  run, so this single workflow dispatch supplied the hosted post-release check.
- Evidence is in `artifacts/lifecycle-release-20261016/` in the isolated
  worktree: `recovery/`, `permissions/`, `candidate-2-admin/`,
  `candidate-2-visitor/`, `production-admin/` and `production-visitor/`.
  Recovery deployment is `dpl_F39b2Mi6SE1owJWJJ52xBQwBPFKG` (`8b05a25`). Keep
  new private tables and original files when rolling back the app; do not drop
  data. The backup and smoke artifacts are private/ignored, not deploy assets.

Loading waterfall reduction (implemented 2026-10-11, released 2026-10-12):

- Read-only production probes found avoidable serialized reads in Visitor map
  startup, the Admin dashboard, forecast-file import and the unified area view.
  Independent requests now start concurrently through existing authenticated
  loaders. Account ownership, pinned revisions, fail-closed behavior, explicit
  publication and the page-readiness overlay remain unchanged.
- The area view may identify its resource type from the account-owned catalog
  to start the published counterpart early. Unknown/old links still wait for
  the explicitly requested revision; they never substitute a newer resource.
- Pushed only this chat's changes as `f756b6a` and `8b05a25` on
  `fix/forecast-touch-pan-20261006`. The latter adds `.vercelignore` matching
  `.gitignore` so local artifacts, dependencies and env files stay out of CLI
  deployment uploads. No tracked source is excluded.
- [Quality Gate 38156665900](https://github.com/purichw/KoratTanPhai/actions/runs/38156665900),
  attempt 2, passed all seven jobs on exact `8b05a25`. Attempt 1 was blocked
  before runner steps by GitHub billing. After the owner changed the repository
  to public, the unchanged rerun completed successfully; no tests or gates were
  removed and no speculative code repair was needed.
- Promoted the existing production-configured candidate
  `dpl_F39b2Mi6SE1owJWJJ52xBQwBPFKG`
  (`https://korattanphai-6iegaqz75-purich-w.vercel.app`) after authenticated
  read-only candidate smoke passed: 39 Visitor checks, Admin navigation and
  area workflows, and reviewed-file download/external repair/revalidation on
  desktop/mobile. Rechecked the primary alias against `3742db7` immediately
  before promotion and against `8b05a25` afterward. Supabase/CMS markers,
  `fallback: false`, and no-store process health passed.
- Post-promotion [Deployment Smoke 38159969482](https://github.com/purichw/KoratTanPhai/actions/runs/38159969482)
  passed against the production alias with exact `8b05a25` harness source.
  Local read-only Admin navigation/areas and import-review smoke also passed
  on desktop/mobile, including separate Visitor/Admin sessions and no
  application-data writes. Evidence is in the isolated worktree's
  `artifacts/performance-20261011/candidate/` and `production-release/`.
- No migration, production application-data mutation or unrelated checkout
  work is included. Recovery deployment is
  `dpl_BU1exuHZeWZUWaAtEAFVGpiqcjVK` (`3742db7`). See
  [PERFORMANCE_20261011.md](PERFORMANCE_20261011.md) for scoped evidence and
  measurement limits; no specific percentage speedup is claimed.

Admin import review and offline repair release (2026-10-08):

- Released only this chat's repairable Admin import and reviewed-file work on
  `fix/forecast-touch-pan-20261006`. Commits `05fc8bc` and `3742db7` add source-row
  diagnostics, explicit on-screen repairs, shared API inspection, reviewed
  Excel/CSV downloads, and validation on reupload. Existing publication gates,
  visitor data, permissions and unrelated checkout changes are preserved.
- All seven jobs passed in [Quality Gate 37776954891](https://github.com/purichw/korattanphai/actions/runs/37776954891).
  Full built coverage passed 216 cases, database-mode coverage 150, and CMS-mode
  coverage 53, with pre-existing mode/viewport skips retained. Local checks also
  passed 481 unit tests, 21 related backend/database tests, and 12 focused built
  desktop/mobile cases. The first CI attempt exposed missing JSON import
  attributes through the new exporter dependency; the fix was reproduced using
  complete test discovery. The station fixture now also seeds CMS references,
  and CMS CI explicitly includes the new import-repair tests.
- Promoted exact candidate `dpl_BU1exuHZeWZUWaAtEAFVGpiqcjVK`
  (`https://korattanphai-37kigrvr8-purich-w.vercel.app`) after authenticated
  read-only candidate checks passed: import/download/external-edit/reupload,
  39 visitor checks, and desktop/mobile Admin navigation and area workflows.
  The production alias was checked against `35a6e9c` immediately before
  promotion and verified against `3742db7` afterward. Both backend markers
  confirm Supabase/CMS with `fallback: false`.
- Candidate visitor smoke initially observed one forecast RPC HTTP 500 at
  `/phimai/t-301503`. A targeted read-only probe subsequently returned HTTP 200
  for all requests and rendered 289 polygons across the same routes. One
  unchanged diagnostic rerun passed all 39 checks. This records observed
  recovery, not a proven root cause or a fix for intermittent backend failures;
  no timeout, fallback, assertion or release gate was weakened.
- Post-promotion authenticated read-only checks also passed on the production
  alias: reviewed-file import/revalidation, all 39 visitor checks, and Admin
  navigation/area workflows on desktop and mobile. Evidence is under
  `artifacts/forecast-touch-pan-20261006/artifacts/import-release-20261008/`:
  `candidate-final/`, `candidate-final-retry/`, `probe.json`, and `production/`.
  Recovery deployment: `dpl_GuFJRXDVjnArgnMrLh53bNvsDonb` (`35a6e9c`).
- No migration or production application-data mutation. Raw reviews are
  memory-only until a draft is saved; downloads are review snapshots and every
  reupload is revalidated. New forecast origins, geometry replacement, native
  iOS builds, physical-device testing and native Excel rendering are outside
  this release. See [ADMIN_CMS.md](ADMIN_CMS.md) for exact format boundaries.

Mobile forecast touch-pan production release (2026-10-07):

- Promoted the existing verified candidate `dpl_GuFJRXDVjnArgnMrLh53bNvsDonb`
  (`https://korattanphai-oipy4gd3g-purich-w.vercel.app`) to the primary alias.
  Runtime is `35a6e9c`; no new application changes or duplicate build were
  needed during this continuation. The primary alias was checked against
  `f135936` immediately before promotion and against the intended SHA afterward.
- The preceding hosted-smoke block was re-investigated before retrying. Fresh
  request timing showed all three CMS geometry reads returning HTTP 200 in
  approximately 0.9-1.5 seconds, versus 14.6 seconds in the earlier diagnostic.
  All 289 polygons loaded. This demonstrates recovered observed latency, not
  a proven root cause or a guarantee that the intermittent slowdown is fixed.
  Application timeouts, CMS data, access controls and release assertions remain
  unchanged. The local touch harness now waits for map-data readiness using its
  existing action timeout before checking visibility and gestures.
- Final-candidate and production authenticated read-only smoke both passed:
  39 visitor checks, desktop/mobile map-label and pinch coverage, and horizontal
  touch pan on `/`, `/drought`, `/soeng-sang`, and `/phimai/t-301503`. Vertical
  page scrolling, unchanged zoom, next-tap preview and no horizontal overflow
  were verified. The map/touch harnesses reported no application writes.
- Hosted markers confirm Supabase forecasts and CMS references with
  `fallback: false`. Current source/CI evidence remains the successful full
  [Quality Gate 37472277405](https://github.com/purichw/korattanphai/actions/runs/37472277405).
  Docs-only closeout does not require another runtime deployment.
- Evidence under `artifacts/forecast-touch-pan-20261006/artifacts/`:
  `network-probe-20261007.json`, `candidate-smoke-20261007/`, and
  `production-smoke-20261007/`. Mobile production screenshots accompany each
  touch route. Physical iPhone verification was not performed.
- Recovery remains `dpl_CsXdJbb13WkbfGeS5tPV7MsGQnwa` (`f135936`). Existing
  production cleanup and unrelated work were preserved. No migration or
  production application-data mutation was performed.

Mobile forecast touch-pan release candidate (2026-10-06, not promoted):

- Pushed `fix/forecast-touch-pan-20261006`; candidate source is
  `35a6e9cffc94decb44280cc32333e0e33bb22593`. The isolated worktree is
  `artifacts/forecast-touch-pan-20261006`, based on `4523b9d`; existing
  production cleanup and unrelated root changes are preserved.
- Horizontal one-finger swipes now pan immediately. Vertical-first gestures
  retain native page scrolling, and a cancelled scroll does not consume the
  next ordinary tap. No Admin, CSS, database or native-app changes are included.
- All seven jobs passed in [Quality Gate 37472277405](https://github.com/purichw/korattanphai/actions/runs/37472277405).
  Local verification included 467 unit tests, protected build/exposure/bundle
  gates, and 32 repeated focused mobile cases across database and built modes.
  The first CI run exposed a test race: native momentum moved the page during
  coordinate hit testing. The test now waits for stable page scroll without
  changing its gesture, map, or tap assertions.
- Production-configured candidate `dpl_GuFJRXDVjnArgnMrLh53bNvsDonb`
  (`https://korattanphai-oipy4gd3g-purich-w.vercel.app`) is READY, with explicit
  Supabase/CMS flags and the hosted CMS marker reporting `fallback: false`.
  It is NOT promoted: required authenticated candidate smoke remains blocked.
- Earlier `fc65231` candidate passed visitor, map-label and four-route touch
  checks. Those results are not substituted for the final candidate gate.
  The final candidate intermittently failed to load geometry within the app's
  existing timeout during visitor smoke. A read-only network probe observed
  successful CMS responses, including a 14.6-second geometry read and all 289
  polygons, but subsequent full smoke failed again. A separate touch harness
  also timed out at its initial readiness assertion before exercising gestures.
  No timeouts or assertions were weakened and repeated blind retries stopped.
- Evidence: `artifacts/forecast-touch-pan-20261006/artifacts/` contains
  `ci-first-failure`, `verified-touch-settled`, `verified-touch-built`,
  `candidate-verified-smoke`, `candidate-verified-map`, `candidate-final-smoke`,
  `candidate-touch-final`, and `network-probe.json`/`.png`.
- Next: diagnose hosted CMS transport/readiness, obtain a passing final-candidate
  read-only smoke, recheck the primary alias, then promote and verify production.
  Do not infer that CI success alone authorizes bypassing the candidate gate.
  The primary alias was rechecked and still serves `f135936` from
  `dpl_CsXdJbb13WkbfGeS5tPV7MsGQnwa`; this remains the recovery deployment.
  No production data mutation or physical-iPhone verification was performed.

Actions usage rollout (2026-10-03, verified 21:18 Asia/Bangkok):

- `e60716c` passed full [Quality Gate 37128487838](https://github.com/purichw/korattanphai/actions/runs/37128487838),
  including all five heavy jobs and final `regression`. The automatic Preview
  succeeded. The production receipt below remains a separate release event.
- Conservative docs-only selection preserves required gates and verifies the
  latest exact-base run/attempt before skipping heavy jobs. The first full-mode
  result is verified; hosted docs-mode proof awaits a genuine eligible docs push.
- See [ACTIONS_USAGE.md](ACTIONS_USAGE.md) for the measured baseline, public
  visibility caveat, diagnostic checkpoints and unchanged coverage. No savings
  percentage is inferred from a single faster full run.

Legacy cleanup production release (2026-10-03):

- Pushed this chat's cleanup on `fix/legacy-cleanup-20261003` and released
  runtime `f1359369c44f49357ad25513d1a6343897bfd9f7`. Preserved the already
  deployed Admin area workspace from `3df31e873d2eb7476fa0be5df78630230580acf5`;
  the root checkout and unrelated worktrees were not edited.
- All six required jobs passed in [Quality Gate 37121917888](https://github.com/purichw/korattanphai/actions/runs/37121917888).
  Protected build, exposure and unchanged bundle-budget checks passed. Stale
  area-page selectors and a four-layer geometry expectation were corrected,
  with focused browser verification before the final CI run.
- Promoted the verified candidate `dpl_CsXdJbb13WkbfGeS5tPV7MsGQnwa`
  (`https://korattanphai-id0lktxum-purich-w.vercel.app`). The primary alias was
  checked immediately before promotion against the preserved production
  revision, then confirmed to resolve to the intended runtime.
- Both production build flags are explicit: database forecasts and CMS
  references. The Vercel environment snapshot had an empty reference flag;
  that candidate was rejected and never promoted. The accepted build and
  hosted marker confirm CMS mode without a static geometry fallback.
- Candidate and production authenticated read-only checks passed on desktop
  and mobile: Admin navigation, area list/map/filter/selection/download,
  templates, independent sessions, and four map-label states including mobile
  pinch. Reports confirm zero application writes and CMS geometry reads.
  Production verification completed at 19:32 ICT; health checks passed too.
- Live verification found all five active reference payloads and hashes
  unchanged, two preload resources, 40 retained historical resources and
  13 passing denied-access checks. No migration, ACL change or production
  data mutation was performed; existing drafts and history remain intact.
- Evidence and recovery details: `LEGACY_CLEANUP_20261003.md` and
  `artifacts/legacy-audit-20261003/`. Native builds were outside this web release.

Legacy cleanup (initial local checkpoint, before the production release above):

- Approved cleanup is isolated in `artifacts/legacy-cleanup-20261003`, branch
  `fix/legacy-cleanup-20261003`, from production baseline
  `ce9d98ba021f087675ce61c8645d30c233472bae`. Root checkout remains untouched.
- Removed 51 approved files: 39 legacy JSON resources including rev02, country
  context geometry, two old builders, six demo/runtime/API files and three old
  brand binaries. `OperationalFilters.tsx` was retained because Overview still
  uses it; its synthetic defaults/store coupling were removed instead.
- Current startup uses five genuine CMS resources, with only hierarchy and
  forecast summary preloaded. Admin lists real area/map resources; historical
  versions remain readable but inactive keys cannot be edited/published.
- Removed unreachable nationwide/persona/event/advisory UI, fake workflow
  persistence, old map/readiness branches and fixed agency source projections.
  Forecasts, exports, CSV/Excel import, real Auth/saved workspaces, mobile map
  labels and the parked generic Actual/agriculture designs are preserved.
- No database data or migration was changed. The exact cutover verification
  draft exception remains pending a separate archival policy; compatibility
  URLs, old Excel codepages and provenance/security guards remain intentional.
- Restore checkpoint and evidence: see `LEGACY_CLEANUP_20261003.md` and the
  2026-10-03 entry in `rollback-parking-lot.md`.


Admin resource-detail production release (2026-10-01):

- Released this chat's Admin detail work from `fix/admin-navigation-20261001`.
  Runtime commit `3e2703a9f429234bb0e9f630c5d40bcf7de92a1c` includes the
  published Home URL baseline `02d8f6243c752b199ccc303f27c3995742d0b284`;
  the root checkout and unrelated worktrees were not changed. The deployed
  detail screen includes the reviewed desktop/mobile layout, real metrics,
  search/filter/sort/pagination, row details and selected-record CSV export.
- A tracked-source archive was built with production configuration and the
  protected build, exposure and unchanged bundle-budget gates passed. All six
  required jobs passed in [Quality Gate 36851888162](https://github.com/purichw/korattanphai/actions/runs/36851888162).
  Authenticated read-only candidate checks passed before promotion. The primary
  alias was checked again immediately beforehand and still pointed at the
  preserved Home URL baseline.
- Promoted deployment `dpl_ASnhXFZL7e98rzAp3irav3HCDyBF`
  (`https://korattanphai-mhjjf611a-purich-w.vercel.app`). Confirmed
  `https://korattanphai.vercel.app` resolves to that deployment and exact runtime
  commit. This supersedes the local-only checkpoints below.
- Authenticated production checks passed at desktop and mobile widths: Admin
  navigation, resource search/district filtering, selection across pages,
  exact two-record CSV download, row dialog/focus, reload/history/back,
  import template download and independent Admin/visitor sessions. Images
  loaded, pages had no horizontal overflow or application errors, and the
  harness recorded zero application writes on both devices. No migration,
  ACL change or production data edit was performed.
- Evidence: `artifacts/admin-resource-release-20261001/quality-gate.json`,
  `candidate/` and `production/` contain deployment identities, smoke reports,
  geometry and screenshots. Production desktop/mobile full-page detail images
  were personally inspected after promotion and match the reviewed candidate.
  Physical-device testing was not repeated for this web release.

Admin warm reads and tab-return regression (2026-10-02, local; not deployed):

- Continue in `artifacts/home-clean-url-release-20261001/source`, branch
  `fix/admin-reference-groups-20261001`, baseline `7de05a6`. This includes
  the preceding catalogue grouping work from this chat; root runtime files
  remain untouched.
- `src/admin/client.ts` now retains up to 16 successful reads per mounted
  account workspace. `useAdminRead.ts` serves matching warm data immediately
  while rechecking the server on entry/retry. It is used by AdminWorkspace,
  PublishedForecasts and ReferenceResources; no persisted Admin-data cache.
- Initial uncached entry remains covered. Returning from imports/detail and
  manual refresh keep loaded panels visible. Same-user SDK notifications and
  browser-tab return preserve search/form DOM without new Admin requests.
  Full document reload still loads afresh.
- Mutation invalidation excludes late pre-save reads. Warm draft/resource
  detail requests disable editing until the latest revision arrives. Manual
  refresh respects unsaved edits; server session/membership checks and
  conflict detection are unchanged. Denied reads remove their old results.
- Baseline regression reproduced imports-to-home full-page loading; browser
  focus/auth events alone did not reproduce the report in the isolated fixture.
  No unverified auth workaround or automatic focus refetch was introduced.
- Verified final implementation: TypeScript/CMS-mode build, 42 focused unit
  checks and 12 desktop/mobile browser cases (tab/session return, sign-out,
  unsaved edit/save, menu/detail return, delayed manual refresh, warm draft
  revision safety, and source edit/reload/publication/public bundle).
  All browser writes used the isolated test database.
- Evidence: `artifacts/home-clean-url-release-20261001/admin-resume-{after,refresh}`
  and sibling build/unit/browser logs. Personally inspected warm navigation
  screenshots at both widths. No full-site CI, live production smoke, commit,
  push, deployment, migration, billing change or production write.


Admin reference catalogue grouping (local follow-up, not deployed):

- Implemented the approved three task groups: ข้อมูลพื้นที่, ชั้นข้อมูลแผนที่
  and แหล่งข้อมูลอ้างอิง. The map group discloses three active geometries;
  nested search and category filters work on desktop and mobile.
- Station locations, station proximity and neighboring-country geometry are
  absent from the main catalogue/search. Their payloads, bootstrap registration,
  historical versions, old deep links and downloads remain unchanged.
- The source view keeps five drought/agriculture references and labels them
  อ้างอิงประกอบ; it does not claim they feed the forecast model. Editing uses
  original payload indices and retains all nine original source records,
  including hidden rows.
- Work is isolated on `fix/admin-reference-groups-20261001` in
  `artifacts/home-clean-url-release-20261001/source`, based on `7de05a6`.
  Root Admin files were not overwritten; unrelated dirty root work remains.
- Verified: TypeScript/CMS-mode build; 9 focused unit checks; 6 desktop/mobile
  browser journeys covering groups/search/filters, map disclosure, retained
  deep-link export and filtered-source edit/reload/publication/public-bundle
  parity. Source editing/publication used only the isolated database fixture.
  The two catalogue journeys were repeated for expanded/collapsed snapshots.
- Visually inspected desktop/mobile full-page and grouped-panel snapshots in
  `artifacts/home-clean-url-release-20261001/admin-reference-groups-visual/`.
  No overflow or runtime errors in the tested flows. Full-site CI and live
  production smoke are deferred until a release request. No commit, push,
  deployment, migration or production data write was performed.

Admin detail visual rework after mockup comparison (2026-10-01; local only):

- Revisited both supplied internal-page references and the prior rendered
  screenshots. Removes the duplicate back-button row, uses the breadcrumb as
  the return path, and puts refresh alongside it. Read-only guidance and the
  mobile last-save timestamp remain reachable inside History; source editing
  guidance and publication controls remain visible in their existing flow.
- Desktop now separates the slim search/filter surface from the compact table;
  real metrics keep centered contents with distinct icon tints and a publication
  badge. Mobile uses a dark compact header scoped to resource details, individual
  bordered record cards and a shorter internal list viewport. Twenty rows remain
  reachable per page; no data/status/action was invented from the mock.
- Mobile shows selected-row export controls/help when rows are selected; the
  select-page label explicitly explains downloading. Search, filtering, selection
  across pages, CSV, detail dialog focus, reload/back navigation and mobile menu
  are verified. First-list position changes from y604 to y382 at 390px width;
  the unselected page changes from 1334px to 882px in the final capture.
- Twelve scoped browser cases pass (detail, home navigation, reference reads,
  no-code forecast correction, station workbook import and source save/reload/
  publication) across desktop/mobile; the detail cases were refreshed after the
  final mobile type adjustment. TypeScript and diff checks pass. No full-site
  suite, release CI or production writes/deployment for this visual follow-up.
- Evidence: `artifacts/admin-resource-evidence-20261001/polish-confirmed/`,
  `polish-final/`, `polish-source-check/` and `polish-comparisons/`. Both full-page
  and viewport renders, active mobile selection, and the three-way reference /
  earlier screenshot / current development comparison were personally inspected.
  Remaining intentional differences: centered metrics, real 289/32 counts,
  fewer supported columns/actions and 20 rows/page. Production is unchanged.

Admin resource-detail adaptation (2026-10-01; local, not pushed or deployed):

- Adopts the new internal-page desktop/mobile references where backed by the
  existing resource contract: one specific page heading and breadcrumb, real
  projected row counts, revision/publication state, CMS last-save time, district
  filtering, sorting and 10/20/50-row page size. The default remains 20 rows and
  original source order. Mobile uses scrollable record cards and a filter toggle.
- `ReferenceRecords` owns read-only browsing and selection, reusing shared
  `AppSelect`, `WorkspaceEmptyState` and dialog behavior. `ReferenceResources`
  still owns fetching, source-registry draft edits, history and publication.
- Checkboxes select original payload row identities across pages and sorting;
  CSV downloads exactly the selected projected rows in the current sort order.
  Search/district changes clear selection, as do resource/revision changes.
  CSV has Thai column labels, UTF-8 BOM, escaping and spreadsheet-formula guards.
  It is a readable review export, not an editable source/import replacement.
- Actual hierarchy contains 289 subdistricts and 32 districts; the illustrated
  304 count, per-row linked/active status and 100% linkage are not asserted.
  Area link/unlink/delete/edit actions have no supporting product contract and
  were not introduced. Source-registry edit/save/publish remains available.
- All eight distinct scoped desktop/mobile browser cases pass: detail selection,
  CSV download, search/filter/sort/page size, last-row scrolling, dialog focus,
  route reload/history/return, home navigation, station reads and source edits
  through publication/public reload in an isolated CMS database. All 21 focused
  presentation/CSV unit cases pass; TypeScript and diff checks pass.
- Evidence: `artifacts/admin-resource-evidence-20261001/confirmed/`, `final/` and
  `final-comparisons/`. Full-page/viewport screenshots were personally inspected;
  comparison reference crops are inferred from annotated raster images, not
  exact CSS measurements. Physical devices, full-site/release CI and production
  smoke were not rerun for this local follow-up. Production remains the release
  recorded below; this checkpoint does not assert new deployment.

Clean default Home URL production release (2026-10-01):

- Released only this chat's Home URL work from isolated branch
  `fix/home-clean-url-20261001`, based on verified production `06f2d8d`.
  Runtime `02d8f6243c752b199ccc303f27c3995742d0b284` preserves the already
  published Admin, design, data, access and layout changes. Unrelated dirty root
  work is excluded.
- Latest-origin T+1 Home normalizes to `/`. Historical months and other
  horizons remain explicit; filters/hash, search, bookmarks and Excel export
  retain the displayed origin. Fresh entry/reload resolves the latest archive.
- Required smoke exposed the same pre-existing missing-origin recovery failure
  on the baseline and first candidate. The recovery link now uses native
  navigation to clear stale same-route state. Four-route regression passes at
  desktop/mobile widths. The first candidate was never promoted.
- Local evidence: 45 focused Home/unit-hook checks, TypeScript/diff checks and
  two database browser journeys covering recovery at Home, province, district
  and tambon levels. The local browser runner uses installed Chrome; the default
  downloaded Playwright binary was unavailable. A cold dev-module wait was
  aligned with the existing workspace readiness checks.
- [Exact-runtime Quality Gate](https://github.com/purichw/korattanphai/actions/runs/36824228091)
  passes all six required jobs: contracts, built-browser, database-browser,
  cms-browser, browser-compatibility and regression. The hosted protected build,
  exposure and unchanged bundle gates pass (application gzip 227,170 bytes;
  database build emits no static forecast archive).
- Ready candidate `dpl_CjRrs1vbxNytUuYz3ks1wz24Zxhh` /
  `https://korattanphai-k661nhzwm-purich-w.vercel.app` passed authenticated
  read-only desktop/mobile smoke before promotion. The primary alias baseline
  and candidate SHA/project identity were checked immediately before promotion.
- `https://korattanphai.vercel.app` is verified on that exact deployment.
  Candidate and production each pass 22 checks per viewport: legacy/default
  Home, reload, historical selection, bookmarks read-only, geographic search,
  Back, legacy T+4 and explicit missing-origin recovery. Production's mobile
  logout setup needed a harness readiness correction and a successful mobile
  rerun; the initial report is retained rather than counted as a pass.
- Current production desktop/mobile screenshots were visually inspected.
  Map, dropdown and card geometry matches the baseline, including aligned
  desktop map/card bottoms. No application writes, runtime/network errors,
  operational reads or horizontal overflow were observed. No migration,
  production content edit, role assignment, billing or native change is included.
  Physical-device checks and live saved-filter writes are outside this release.
- Evidence: `artifacts/home-clean-url-release-20261001/`, including isolated
  `source/`, `ci-final.json`, `candidate-final/`, `production/`, successful
  mobile-rerun evidence, and deployment guards. Recovery baseline:
  `dpl_GpuVxqnMkSz2v2yZaNCByWxmaDvh` /
  `https://korattanphai-6purvg7t0-purich-w.vercel.app` (`06f2d8d`).
  This release supersedes the earlier local-only Home URL checkpoint.

Admin data-home reference redesign, production release (2026-10-01):

- Adopts the supplied desktop/mobile mockups' icon-led header, three white panels,
  green review action, aligned month controls, draft status rows and reference
  card grid. Mobile has a light emblem/wordmark header, compact draft cards and
  explicit resource expansion. Real search/filter matches remain reachable.
- Reuses `MetricGrid`, `MonthSelect`, buttons and the responsive navigation.
  The three Admin-only destinations and independent sessions remain unchanged.
  Visitor/settings/media/notification mock elements are not new product features.
- Values are source-backed: current forecast catalogue count, existing rev3
  six-month horizon and current published status. Resource row totals in the
  illustration are omitted because the catalogue API does not supply them;
  real usage descriptions remain available in resource detail. No fake readiness
  or record counts are substituted. Centered stats follow the owner's preference.
- Read-only smoke now captures full-page and viewport evidence on both widths,
  and exercises mobile resource expansion/search in addition to navigation,
  template download and session separation. No production content writes.
- Isolated source remains in `artifacts/admin-navigation-20261001` on
  `fix/admin-navigation-20261001`, preserving the verified `93367df` release and
  the root checkout's unrelated changes. Runtime
  `06f2d8dd76bab853abc9e7d4e136c0f6974bee13` is pushed and deployed.
- TypeScript, syntax/diff checks and 24 targeted local browser cases pass across
  design/search/disclosure, navigation, authentication, rev3 CSV/XLS/XLSX,
  no-code forecast editing, workbook roundtrip and loading/error states.
  [Exact-runtime Quality Gate](https://github.com/purichw/korattanphai/actions/runs/36767087460)
  passes all six required jobs without changing budgets or exclusions.
- Ready candidate `dpl_GpuVxqnMkSz2v2yZaNCByWxmaDvh` /
  `https://korattanphai-6purvg7t0-purich-w.vercel.app` has the exact runtime commit.
  Protected hosted build, source-exposure and unchanged bundle gates pass
  (226,546 B application gzip); the database build emits no static archive.
- The first candidate smoke recorded one forecast-catalog HTTP 503 and failed.
  Its cause was not established. A fresh full run passed on both widths, followed
  by a successful full production run with no HTTP/runtime errors. The smoke
  harness now explicitly waits for the month selector and published metrics before
  screenshots, so an error/loading card cannot be mistaken for visual completion.
- After confirming the primary alias was still on the recorded baseline,
  promoted that exact Ready candidate. `https://korattanphai.vercel.app` is verified
  on `dpl_GpuVxqnMkSz2v2yZaNCByWxmaDvh`. Real-account desktop/mobile smoke passes
  for published forecasts, eight real resources, mobile expansion/search,
  Admin-only navigation, imports/reload, Excel template download and independent
  sessions. Application writes are blocked; no production content was changed.
- Full-page and viewport production screenshots were visually inspected against
  both supplied references. Evidence in `artifacts/admin-design-evidence-20261001/`
  includes `candidate-verified/`, `production/`, `comparisons/` with crop/scale
  provenance, `ci-release.json` and deployment/alias metadata. Reference crop
  geometry is inferred from the supplied raster; this is an adaptive product
  implementation, not a claim of exact pixel parity.
- Recovery baseline: `dpl_CEAjKzMrtrXnCwzZ3Zk8o9UZVsYR` /
  `https://korattanphai-8bdydqagl-purich-w.vercel.app` (runtime `93367df`).
  No database migration, role change, production draft/forecast edit or native
  change is included. Physical-device testing is outside this release. The final
  follow-up changes only this checkpoint and three smoke assertions; runtime
  remains the exact commit above and does not require rebuilding.

Admin navigation reconstruction, production release (2026-10-01):

- Isolated branch `fix/admin-navigation-20261001` starts from verified production
  runtime `3b786cd` in `artifacts/admin-navigation-20261001`. The root checkout's
  unrelated pending work is excluded.
- `AdminNavigation` exposes only data management, imports/drafts and upload.
  Visitor overview/drought/Excel export, search, bookmarks and their database
  workspace provider no longer mount in Admin. Existing branding, responsive
  drawer, account menu and independent authentication remain shared/preserved.
- `?view=imports` and `?view=upload` are restorable CMS destinations. Saved drafts
  highlight imports; import close returns to the list. Navigation still blocks
  unsaved edits, and explicit discard permits leaving the import dialog.
- Runtime `93367df25ce22d7926363139c97e9b6796b25f6f` is pushed on the isolated
  branch. All 20 targeted local browser checks pass across Admin navigation,
  authentication, rev3 imports, CMS editing, loading and the visitor sidebar;
  TypeScript and seven targeted auth/unsaved-change unit checks also pass.
- Two assertion-only follow-ups aligned the old empty-state copy in the CMS and
  loading suites. No test thresholds or runtime behavior were weakened.
- Ready candidate `dpl_CEAjKzMrtrXnCwzZ3Zk8o9UZVsYR` /
  `https://korattanphai-8bdydqagl-purich-w.vercel.app` has the exact runtime commit.
  The hosted protected build, source-exposure and unchanged bundle gates pass
  (226,930 B application gzip); the database build emits no static archive.
- `scripts/smoke-admin-navigation.mjs` passes on the candidate with a real account
  at desktop/mobile widths: Admin-only navigation, imports/reload, Excel template
  download and independent Admin/visitor sessions. Application writes are blocked;
  no data mutations, runtime errors or horizontal overflow were observed.
- [Exact-commit Quality Gate](https://github.com/purichw/korattanphai/actions/runs/36762537574)
  passes all six required jobs, including 188 built-browser and 136 database-browser
  checks; existing provider/viewport exclusions remain unchanged.
- Promoted the exact Ready candidate after confirming that the primary alias was
  still on the recorded baseline. `https://korattanphai.vercel.app` is verified on
  `dpl_CEAjKzMrtrXnCwzZ3Zk8o9UZVsYR`. Production repeats the real-account desktop/mobile
  checks successfully with zero application writes. Sidebar screenshots were
  visually inspected. The root checkout and unrelated pending work remain untouched.
- Recovery baseline: `dpl_CDETdbqUQZeWuSkjMiTmgxCWXn55` /
  `https://korattanphai-b4wr35ah1-purich-w.vercel.app` (runtime `3b786cd`).
- Evidence: `artifacts/admin-navigation-evidence/`, including `candidate-release/`,
  `production/` and `ci-release-final.json`.
  No database migration, role assignment, production draft/forecast edit or native
  change is included. Physical-device testing is outside this release.

Workspace officer-access foundation production release (2026-09-30):

- Runtime `d984513` on `feature/frontend-access-foundation` releases this chat's
  five configurable officer/user role presets, capabilities, geographic levels
  and area grants, strict eligibility checks, React provider/boundary and route
  adapter. The bilingual contract is in `docs/WORKSPACE_ACCESS.md` in the release
  checkout `artifacts/forecast-attention-release-20260930/source`.
- Visitor accounts remain in explicit compatibility mode. No live role assignment,
  geographic restriction, role editor or new server authorization is enabled.
  Admin membership and independent sessions remain unchanged.
- Preserved the current production runtime `6791d75`, including branded page
  loading and toolbar search. Two existing browser assertions were aligned with
  those deployed behaviors; no loading/search runtime change was added here.
  Unpublished root CMS, UAT/API/research work is excluded.
- [Quality Gate](https://github.com/purichw/korattanphai/actions/runs/36686782974)
  passes all six jobs on the exact runtime commit: 413 unit/component tests,
  174 built-browser tests and 136 database-browser tests, plus CMS, compatibility,
  API, operations, security and database/RLS checks. Existing exclusions remain.
  TypeScript and 84 targeted policy/provider/route/auth/loading tests also pass.
- Protected hosted build, source-exposure checks and unchanged bundle budgets
  pass (225,981 B application gzip); the database build emits no static archive.
- Candidate and production real-account read-only smoke pass on desktop/mobile:
  exact forecast/risk rows, search, saved-list reads, district/tambon navigation
  and reload, Admin authorized reads and sidebar parity, and separate session
  logout behavior. No application mutations, prohibited requests, relevant network
  errors or runtime errors were recorded. Screenshots were visually reviewed.
  Navigation-aborted logout requests are recorded separately; UI session isolation
  passes without claiming server-side token invalidation was observed.
- Promoted Ready deployment `dpl_J95CbHDWJRFS5ada4ja371u2jsdn` /
  `https://korattanphai-5piolegin-purich-w.vercel.app`; the primary production alias
  is verified on it. Recovery baseline: `dpl_F2bJGovU3aK6bPhWx8832UDcErvo` /
  `https://korattanphai-kkqx2w3wq-purich-w.vercel.app` (runtime `6791d75`).
- Evidence: `artifacts/access-foundation-release-20260930/`, including
  `release-state.json`, `ci-final.json`, `candidate-final/` and `production/`.
  No database migration, production data/assignment, billing or native changes.
  Physical-device testing and future role enforcement remain outside this release.

CMS clarity and rev3 spreadsheet import, production release (2026-09-30):

- Runtime `7d5ee90`, branch `fix/cms-no-code-20260930`, contains Thai operator
  tables, supported-resource filtering, semantic forecast editing and CSV/XLS/XLSX
  imports with the explained 289-area rev3 template.
- Read-only deployment metadata verified that production advanced through `6791d75`
  to `d984513` (`dpl_J95CbHDWJRFS5ada4ja371u2jsdn`). Those branded-loading and
  access-foundation releases, plus their forecast-attention predecessor, are merged
  into this candidate. Earlier local-only checkpoints below are historical.
- All six required CI jobs, the protected build and unchanged bundle gates pass.
  The final candidate passed 39 real-account desktop/mobile smoke checks plus
  CMS read-only catalogue and template-download checks. A prior smoke encountered
  one forecast RPC HTTP 500; its evidence is retained, and the unchanged rerun
  passed. All 69 focused merged access/CMS/reader unit checks pass.
- Promoted `dpl_Erah1mrD3atdpDNXvcPS3KCDMR4b` after a fresh alias/ancestry guard;
  the public alias was verified. Production passes all 39 desktop/mobile smoke
  checks, authenticated CMS reads and byte-identical CSV/XLSX downloads. Real
  browser inspection confirms the Thai list and 12-field import guide.
  Credentials were used only in memory, without saving or provisioning them.
- [Release evidence and recovery](CMS_NO_CODE_RELEASE_20260930.md) contains
  candidate/CI links, verification results and preservation boundaries.
  The primary dirty checkout, database and unrelated work remain untouched.

Workspace officer-access foundation (2026-09-30, local only):

- `src/access` separates configurable role rules, view levels, capabilities and
  explicit geographic grants. Five starter roles, strict eligibility evaluation,
  a React provider/boundary and canonical-route adapter are prepared.
- Visitor shell remains explicitly in compatibility mode, preserving existing
  account behavior. CMS sessions/operator authorization are untouched.
- See [WORKSPACE_ACCESS.md](WORKSPACE_ACCESS.md) for the bilingual field dictionary,
  examples and remaining trusted-server/RLS, cache, route and action enforcement
  work. This is not live geographic data authorization or a deployed role editor.
- Work is isolated on `feature/frontend-access-foundation` in
  `artifacts/forecast-attention-release-20260930/source`, based on `b545db6`.
  No production data, account assignments, migrations, push or deploy changed.
- Verification: TypeScript and 81 distinct targeted policy/provider/route/auth
  checks pass. One existing desktop overview browser journey passes through
  district filtering, reload, back navigation and tambon drilldown without page
  errors. Local fake-auth/static-source screenshots are under
  `artifacts/access-foundation-smoke/`; the current viewport was inspected.
  Backend authorization, real role accounts, mobile/native and whole-site
  release suites were not exercised because enforcement remains inactive.

Forecast risk lists and sidebar production release (2026-09-30):

- Runtime `92831bb` adds high/moderate risk choices with exact scoped tambon
  lists, an available-level default and a 360 px card with keyboard-accessible
  internal scrolling. Month, district and irrigation scope remain synchronized
  with the summary; links retain source T/T+ and area identity.
- Admin now shares Home sidebar/logo dimensions. The data-management menu entry
  is hidden; direct Admin routes and independent authentication are preserved.
- Released from isolated branch `release/forecast-attention-20260930`, based on
  `7bfeb6d` / production runtime `fea0a2f`. Existing CMS, brand and graph releases
  remain intact. Unpublished CMS, UAT/API/research work and the local bundle-budget
  relaxation are excluded.
- Release `a639f2e` adds a lockfile-only `brace-expansion` security patch after
  the original audit failed. Only three transitive lock entries change to
  1.1.21/2.1.7; audit thresholds and build budgets are unchanged.
- Protected hosted build and exposure/bundle gates pass (224,613 B application
  gzip). Candidate real-account read-only checks pass for desktop/mobile:
  exact 117 moderate / 75 high / 31 moderate rows, empty high state, toggle,
  internal scrolling, reload, hidden menu and Admin/sidebar parity. No runtime
  or relevant network errors, blocked writes or data mutations were recorded.
- [Quality Gate](https://github.com/purichw/korattanphai/actions/runs/36676383302)
  passed all six jobs on exact commit `a639f2e`: 360 unit/component tests and
  321 browser checks passed; 131 existing provider/viewport exclusions were
  skipped. API, operations, CMS publication, migration/RLS and security gates pass.
- Promoted the verified candidate; `korattanphai.vercel.app` serves that exact
  Ready deployment. Production repeats the desktop/mobile visitor and Admin
  smoke successfully with no runtime/network errors or data mutations.
- The first production desktop assertion exhausted its default 5-second wait
  during cold loading; the failure screenshot already showed the correct list.
  Aligning the hosted harness to a 45-second real-network wait resolved the
  timing race; no application changes or value assertions were weakened.
- Candidate: `dpl_F2n7g7EzjBxhXWbvovB2FeSKieJC` /
  `https://korattanphai-31cwiieez-purich-w.vercel.app`.
  Recovery: `dpl_8eHZVnwYySq4uUDBgBeiJqk1Abjq` (preceding sidebar-account release).
- Evidence: `artifacts/forecast-attention-release-20260930/`, including
  `release-state.json`, candidate/production smoke reports and visual proof.
  No migration, billing, native-app or production-data changes. Physical-device
  and unrelated integration verification remain outside this release.

Branded page loading, local implementation (2026-09-30, not deployed):

- Branch `feature/branded-page-loading` in the clean release checkout
  `artifacts/cms-cutover-20260928/source`, based on `7bfeb6d`. Primary-checkout
  unfinished work is not included. Production remains the sidebar release below.
- Visitor and Admin share centered Korat branding and an indeterminate loading
  bar from pre-JavaScript entry through auth, CMS bootstrap and blocking page
  reads. `PageLoadBoundary` keeps incomplete content mounted/measurable but hidden
  and inert until forecast/main geometry or CMS list/catalog/reference reads settle.
- Errors release into existing retry states; slow startup offers reload after
  20 seconds without claiming completion. Optional map context, cached month
  changes and CMS writes do not block the whole page. Reduced motion is supported.
- Type check, static and CMS-mode builds, 18 focused unit tests, 32 built-browser
  loading cases and 6 isolated CMS/bootstrap/independent-auth cases pass. Both
  desktop and mobile screenshots were inspected. A dev-server run hit module-load
  deadlines and was stopped; the built runs passed with unchanged assertion limits.
  Evidence: `artifacts/branded-loading/{built-tests,cms-tests}` in this checkout.
- No deployment, auth policy change, database migration or production data write.
  Local Admin still requires a configured server-side CMS backend; its loading
  behavior was verified against the isolated test database, not a live write flow.
- The same release scope moves global search from navigation into the upper-right
  toolbar beside bookmarks. It reuses the existing green primary-button style,
  with aligned 44px controls and a compact mobile icon. Account stays at the
  sidebar footer; search opening, dismissal and focus return are unchanged.
- Release preparation passes TypeScript, 357 unit tests and the focused desktop/
  mobile toolbar checks. The lockfile updates only transitive `brace-expansion`
  patch versions (1.1.21 and 2.1.7); production dependency audit passes. Remote CI,
  authenticated candidate smoke and final alias verification remain required.
- The pre-promotion guard detected production advancing to `a639f2e` /
  `dpl_F2n7g7EzjBxhXWbvovB2FeSKieJC`. That exact released baseline was merged
  without rewriting either branch, preserving its risk lists and Admin sidebar.
  The original `0c7a031` candidate is superseded and must not be promoted.
  Compatibility recovery tests now expect branded loading while retaining the
  timeout/retry/source-month/horizon assertions; the initial failure expected
  the retired skeleton's status copy. Final merged-source gates remain pending.

Sidebar account release (2026-09-30):

- Runtime `fea0a2f`, branch `release/sidebar-account-20260929`, moves the account
  control to the bottom of the shared left sidebar. Desktop opens upward; mobile
  exposes it at the end of navigation with the existing account sheet. Identity,
  separate visitor/Admin sessions and logout callbacks remain unchanged.
- All six [Quality Gate jobs](https://github.com/purichw/korattanphai/actions/runs/36491550106)
  and 16 focused local cases pass. Candidate passes 39 authenticated smoke checks
  plus real-account sidebar/independent Admin-session checks at both viewports.
- Promoted `dpl_8eHZVnwYySq4uUDBgBeiJqk1Abjq`; production passes all 39 smoke
  checks and the focused real-account sidebar checks at both viewports.
  No data migration, application-data write, auth configuration or native change.
- See [release evidence and recovery](SIDEBAR_ACCOUNT_RELEASE_20260930.md).

CMS cutover and independent Admin login (2026-09-28):

- Runtime `2a84a0e`, branch `release/cms-cutover-20260928`, deployed as
  `dpl_HK4g5ZzWBGwSf8AYoRSgVLhDi2Qz` to the main production alias. All six
  [Quality Gate jobs](https://github.com/purichw/korattanphai/actions/runs/36341840804)
  passed; candidate and final production each passed 39 visitor smoke checks.
- `/admin/login` uses the same existing Supabase users but independent sessions
  from visitor `/login`. Real desktop/mobile checks prove same-scope tab logout
  and that the opposite session still refreshes successfully. Server operator
  membership remains authoritative; personas do not grant access.
- CMS reuses shared login, selects, months, dialogs, buttons, skeletons, brand
  tokens and empty-state presentation. Existing visitor interactions and
  province/district/tambon map/chart/Excel contracts remain intact.
- All 45 reference resources are versioned in Supabase; 34 bootstrap resources
  and on-demand geometry replace bundled reads in production CMS mode, without
  fallback. Every original field in 442,862 rows is unchanged; all 220,218 rev03
  forecast cells retain their source digest. Five approved additive migrations
  were applied; unrelated pending migrations were excluded.
- A labelled unchanged-value QA draft remains unpublished with its audit history.
  New forecast origins/model-result publication, geometry/structural edits,
  binary XLSX retention and UI restore remain gated. iOS is not migrated here.
- One production smoke pass encountered a forecast-load failure. Five cold-route
  repetitions, controlled-failure retry and a full subsequent 39-check run pass;
  the original failure is retained, with no unsupported root-cause claim.
- See [CMS contracts](ADMIN_CMS.md) and [cutover/recovery evidence](CMS_CUTOVER_20260928.md)
  for migrations, artifacts, credentials boundaries, feature gates and recovery.

Softer shared forecast bars production release (2026-09-27):

- Runtime `e6d8623` releases the graph work explicitly authorized from
  “โคราชทันภัย 3”: amber/red gradients, rounded stack tops and softer outlines in
  the shared `ForecastRiskBarGraph`. Values, segment joins, chart dimensions,
  percent/count units and tooltip/keyboard/touch behavior are preserved.
- Released on `release/graph-softness-20260927`, based on `3d54128`.
  The runtime diff contains exactly three graph/component/test files. The
  previously released brand theme and Plus Code lookup remain included;
  uncommitted research/UAT/API work and bundle-budget relaxation are excluded.
- [Quality Gate](https://github.com/purichw/korattanphai/actions/runs/36321466689)
  passed all five jobs on the exact runtime commit. The protected hosted build,
  source-exposure check and unchanged bundle budgets passed (316,547 B app gzip);
  no static forecast archive is exposed.
- Candidate and production each passed 39 authenticated read-only smoke checks
  and eight graph cases: province/district, desktop/mobile and percent/count.
  Exact card/plot/segment geometry and labels match the prior production release;
  gradient/clip ownership, overflow, tooltip interaction and error checks pass.
  Desktop/mobile reference-before-after screenshots were personally reviewed.
- An initial candidate capture measured before map tools mounted. Existing
  `:has(.nr-map-tools)` CSS sets the final chart height after map geometry loads.
  Waiting for map tools and both SVG dimensions resolved this harness race;
  no runtime layout change or loosened geometry assertion was introduced.
- Promoted `dpl_DqWq6D7Y5Vn1654QKGGtCCdLeWjk` /
  `https://korattanphai-lx77ernvs-purich-w.vercel.app`. The primary production
  alias was verified to serve that Ready artifact.
- Evidence: `artifacts/graph-release-20260927/release-state.json`,
  `ci-final.json`, `candidate/`, `production/` and comparison screenshots.
  Recovery: `dpl_9nxHr9FT9iYDkGQSYV95WUmontem` (brand theme release).
  No database migration, application-data write, native-app or billing change.
  Physical-device and unrelated UAT/API integration checks were skipped.

Shared brand surface production release (2026-09-27):

- Runtime `c03cd7e` adds the shared ivory/forest/gold paint layer and one
  reusable 118,484-byte rice-landscape WebP. Component layout, dimensions,
  typography metrics, forecast values and map/chart risk semantics are preserved.
- Released on `release/brand-theme-20260927-v2`, based on `e11c59f`.
  Only the six theme files differ from that production baseline. The Plus Code
  feature already on production is retained. Local UAT/research/API work and
  the uncommitted bundle-budget relaxation are excluded.
- [Quality Gate](https://github.com/purichw/korattanphai/actions/runs/36317441953)
  passed all five jobs on the exact runtime commit: 335 unit, 148 protected
  browser, 134 database browser and six cross-browser checks. Existing
  provider/viewport exclusions remain (122 built-browser and two database skips).
  Hosted protected build, source-exposure and unchanged bundle-budget gates
  passed (316,834 B application gzip); no static forecast archive is exposed.
- Promoted `dpl_9nxHr9FT9iYDkGQSYV95WUmontem` /
  `https://korattanphai-2ru3k388k-purich-w.vercel.app`; inspection confirms
  `https://korattanphai.vercel.app` serves that Ready artifact.
- Candidate and production each passed 39 authenticated read-only smoke checks
  and eight route/viewport visual/asset checks. All 181 measured rectangles and
  font/padding/gap values match the preceding production baseline; risk fill
  sets are unchanged. The deployed WebP decodes and matches committed bytes.
  Candidate account/search/dropdown/analysis focus, playback and map-mode checks
  also passed. Production desktop/mobile comparison screenshots were reviewed.
- The first candidate (`4b97ee8`) passed its gates but was never promoted:
  the pre-promotion guard detected the intervening Plus Code release. The theme
  was applied to the new production baseline and all release gates rerun.
  Do not use that superseded candidate as routine recovery.
- Evidence: `artifacts/brand-release-20260927/release-v2-state.json`,
  `candidate-v2/`, `production-v2/` and `comparison-v2-*.png`.
  No migration, application-data write, native-app or billing change occurred.
  Physical-device testing and unrelated UAT/API integration checks were skipped.
  Recovery: `dpl_Aq5RepuAFryPMtc7Taa8zm4owaW6` (the preceding Plus Code release).

Full Plus Code map lookup production release (2026-09-27):

- Runtime `74c5fa1` adds a Plus Code mode to the shared coordinate lookup.
  Full codes are decoded locally with pinned `open-location-code@1.0.3`;
  no Google Maps API/key or geocoding request is used. The code-area center
  follows the existing Korat boundary, polygon-hole and current-page scope
  checks. Forecasts remain tambon-level, not point or plot risk.
- Short/place-qualified codes, invalid codes, overly coarse codes and points
  outside Korat/current scope are rejected without losing the entered value.
  Existing WGS84 lookup, map selection, pin clearing and dialog focus remain
  covered on province, district and tambon routes at desktop/mobile sizes.
- [Quality Gate](https://github.com/purichw/korattanphai/actions/runs/36315912502)
  passed all five jobs on the exact runtime commit (attempt 2). The first
  attempt could not start because of GitHub billing; the owner changed the
  repository to public before rerunning. Unit tests passed all 335 checks.
- Promoted `dpl_Aq5RepuAFryPMtc7Taa8zm4owaW6` /
  `https://korattanphai-ostzo916x-purich-w.vercel.app`; inspection confirms the
  primary production alias serves this Ready artifact. Protected build,
  source-exposure and unchanged bundle budgets passed (315,602 B app gzip).
- Candidate and production each passed 39 authenticated read-only smoke
  checks plus eight Plus Code route/viewport checks. Desktop/mobile production
  screenshots were reviewed; no runtime errors or Google geocoding requests.
  Evidence: `artifacts/plus-code-release-20260927/`.
- Built from isolated committed source. Unrelated theme, API/UAT/research and
  local budget edits remain unshipped. No database migration, application-data
  write or native-app change occurred. Recovery: `dpl_6QdQEAETfyEHb6EEv5bKsQpcMAfi`,
  the hierarchy release that was live immediately before promotion.

Forecast analysis hierarchy production release (2026-09-24):

- Runtime `6e9c1ac` shares the geography rule: province tables start with
  districts, district tables/charts show their tambons, and tambon scope stays
  at the known source-data leaf. No finer-area forecasts are invented.
- [Quality Gate](https://github.com/purichw/korattanphai/actions/runs/35903158353)
  passed all five jobs on `b2e9b02`. This test-only follow-up corrects the
  remaining Soeng Sang row-count assertion from one district to six tambons.
  Runtime, data and build configuration match the candidate unchanged.
- Promoted `dpl_6QdQEAETfyEHb6EEv5bKsQpcMAfi` /
  `https://korattanphai-7w39aca4w-purich-w.vercel.app`; inspection confirms the
  primary production alias serves this Ready artifact. Protected build,
  source-exposure and unchanged bundle budgets passed (316,373 B app gzip).
- Candidate and production each passed 39 authenticated read-only smoke checks
  plus 10 hierarchy route/viewport checks. All six source risk values, province
  summaries, child-tambon charts, empty reset and map focus were verified.
  Production desktop/mobile screenshots were reviewed. Evidence:
  `artifacts/analysis-hierarchy-release-20260924/`.
- Built from isolated committed source. Unrelated API/UAT/research and local
  budget edits remain unshipped. No database migration, application-data write
  or native-app change occurred. Recovery: `dpl_2ehiLmYBCnuLqrVLMehtydjNoLxf`,
  the compact-playback release already live before this promotion.

Compact playback production release (2026-09-24):

- Runtime `a4ac283` reduces desktop playback width from 176 to 156 px through
  two scoped CSS declarations; desktop/mobile control heights stay 36/40 px.
- [Quality Gate](https://github.com/purichw/korattanphai/actions/runs/35898059095)
  passed all five jobs on the exact runtime commit. Protected build,
  source-exposure and unchanged bundle-budget checks also passed.
- Promoted `dpl_2ehiLmYBCnuLqrVLMehtydjNoLxf` /
  `https://korattanphai-2rs9uw3v4-purich-w.vercel.app`; Vercel inspection confirms
  the primary production alias serves this Ready artifact.
- Candidate and production passed targeted authenticated desktop/mobile checks:
  T+1 through T+6, pause/resume, readable text, stable map/control dimensions,
  no horizontal overflow or browser errors. Production screenshots were reviewed.
  Evidence: `artifacts/playback-compact-release-20260924/`.
- Deployed from an isolated tracked-source archive. Other pending local changes
  remain unshipped. Recovery: `dpl_GPqAAQ9S7SUWvsHcF7mi7wzGTogd`.

Map toolbar production release (2026-09-24):

- Runtime `c55329f` centers the shared map tools and removes the empty status
  row above the map. Active filter feedback appears over the map without resizing
  its frame. The drought workspace toolbar-to-map gap is 6 px on desktop/mobile.
- [Quality Gate](https://github.com/purichw/korattanphai/actions/runs/35893768353)
  passed all five jobs on `95154f8`. That follow-up changes only two E2E startup
  readiness gates; runtime, build configuration and data match the candidate.
- Promoted `dpl_GPqAAQ9S7SUWvsHcF7mi7wzGTogd` /
  `https://korattanphai-58xv6r9lw-purich-w.vercel.app`; inspection confirms
  `https://korattanphai.vercel.app` serves this Ready artifact. Protected build,
  source-exposure and unchanged bundle-budget checks passed.
- Candidate and production each passed 39 authenticated read-only smoke checks
  and eight toolbar route/viewport checks, including filters, reset, stable map
  dimensions and playback. Production desktop/mobile screenshots were reviewed.
  Evidence: `artifacts/map-toolbar-release-20260924/production/` and
  `artifacts/map-toolbar-release-20260924/release-state.json`.
- Built from tracked source only; unrelated API/UAT/research and local budget
  edits remain unshipped. No database migration or application-data write occurred.
  Recovery artifact: `dpl_HhLSC4paSieFzZvgnBzsUmNt4wsM` (forecast-only).

Forecast-only restoration, owner-authorized forward change (2026-09-20):

- The owner requested restoring the forecast website, then push/deploy. This
  supersedes the Actual-by-default release below. `bcbcd33` was docs-only;
  runtime routing from `8357b02` is selectively parked, not fully reverted.
- All routes now use rev03 forecasts; plain T/h links keep their original
  meaning. Retired `period` never becomes a forecast origin. Root T+2..T+6
  retains district scope. No Actual switch/banner or operational API dependency.
- Restored map month and page horizon controls through shared components.
  Retained searchable dropdowns, layout/graph/empty-state fixes, analysis,
  Cordia Excel export, source lineage, freshness checks and bookmarks.
- Recovery: `artifacts/rollback-forecast-only/`, baseline `bcbcd33`; see
  [parking note](rollback-parking-lot.md) and
  [current contract](FORECAST_ONLY_RESTORATION.md).
- No database migration/ACL/source changes. Unrelated UAT/research edits and
  the paused untracked iOS setup are excluded.
- Production restored by forward runtime commit `924e3946ea84b379f39668bb46479ac8db7f86fc`.
  Follow-ups `0c1e9b9`, `da35167`, `1242475` change two E2E files only:
  restore dropdown assertions and allow cold CI geometry/multi-route loading.
  All runtime, build configuration and data match the smoked candidate unchanged.
- [Quality Gate](https://github.com/purichw/korattanphai/actions/runs/35514742374)
  passed all five jobs on `124247589298aaa6cca0957c272a4a5c2d20d296`:
  314 unit, 104 model-input, 12 operations, database integrity, 148 protected
  browser (112 existing provider/legacy skips), 124 database browser (2 duplicate
  viewport skips), 6 cross-browser checks and the final regression gate.
  Earlier CI failures were stale temporal-control assertions and dev-server
  readiness/time budgets, corrected and rerun without removing data checks.
- Promoted `dpl_HhLSC4paSieFzZvgnBzsUmNt4wsM` /
  `https://korattanphai-312ana5og-purich-w.vercel.app`.
  Vercel inspection confirms `https://korattanphai.vercel.app` serves that
  Ready artifact. Hosted protected app: 316,522 B gzip; unchanged bundle limits
  and source-exposure checks pass. No static forecast fallback assets are shipped.
- Candidate and production each passed 39 authenticated read-only smoke checks:
  forecast defaults, legacy periods, province/district/tambon source color parity,
  both graph units, month sync, irrigation/empty reset, saved-workspace reads,
  logout, assets and headers. No page calls the parked operational API.
  Excel checks verified 1,734 province and 36 district risk values, summaries,
  native charts and PivotTables. Desktop/mobile screenshots were reviewed.
- Evidence: `artifacts/forecast-only-release/{candidate,production}/report.json`,
  screenshots and downloaded workbooks. Mobile top/scrolled captures also verify
  the sticky menu stays at y=0. Physical iOS/Android devices were not tested.
- The previous deployment `dpl_5v26dDKrV3zMCJzr99rCNJJd4tTW` reactivates the
  now-parked Actual UI; do not promote it as routine recovery without owner approval.
  No database rollback is needed. Future Actual work follows the parking note.

Actual / forecast separation production release (2026-09-20):

- Runtime `8357b02340d74e90f2ab84e9db7d8447a09d8872` and test-runner follow-up
  `d2b7695be8c4a97411d947490a903aa6b6efcabb` are pushed on
  `fix/nr-map-zoom-performance`. The follow-up changes tests/dev warmup only;
  runtime, build configuration and data match the candidate byte for byte.
- Operational routes now use the valid/data month and server Bangkok clock.
  Actual and operational forecast sources remain **unconfigured**: missing data
  stays neutral/unavailable, never forecast-as-actual or zero risk. The explicit
  rev03 archive retains original values, Auth/RLS, T+1..T+6, maps and Excel.
  This is the deployed separation/source-gap experience, not live actual-feed UAT.
- This task's shared controls, map/analysis/report and Excel refinements are included.
  Mobile dropdowns scroll only their own list; tambon map filters reuse the shared
  grid after duplicate temporal controls were removed. No aggregate tambon chart
  was introduced. Excel uses Cordia and preserves source traceability.
- [Quality Gate](https://github.com/purichw/korattanphai/actions/runs/35508515552)
  passed all five jobs: contracts, browser compatibility (6 passed), database
  browser (126 passed, 2 skipped), protected built browser (150 passed, 112 skipped)
  and regression. Provider-specific exclusions are retained. Local gates also
  passed 314 unit, 104 model-input, 12 operations and 11 database/integrity tests.
- Promoted the exact real-account-smoked candidate `dpl_5v26dDKrV3zMCJzr99rCNJJd4tTW`
  / `https://korattanphai-cjso1yrd8-purich-w.vercel.app`. Inspection confirms the
  production alias serves this Ready artifact. Hosted protected core is 321,139 B
  gzip; existing limits and source-exposure checks pass without a budget increase.
- Candidate and production each passed 39 read-only real-account checks at
  1440x960 and 390x844: actual unavailable at province/district/tambon without
  archive RPC, explicit archive colors/RPC parity, both graph units, month sync,
  irrigation/empty reset, saved-workspace reads, logout, assets and security headers.
  Downloaded Excel validates 1,734 province and 36 district risk cells, summaries,
  native charts and PivotTables. Production screenshots were visually reviewed.
  Evidence: `artifacts/separation-release/{candidate,production}/report.json`,
  screenshots and downloaded workbooks. Physical-device checks were not performed.
- Built from an isolated tracked archive. Unrelated API UAT/research edits and
  their bundle-budget allowance remain unshipped. No migration, application-data
  write, ACL change, feed activation or cross-task coordination occurred.
- Previous artifact: `dpl_A8iPHuHNK4a6KZaG9WmKcGwFxjjg` /
  `https://korattanphai-8wkl3diot-purich-w.vercel.app`. Do not blindly restore it:
  recovery must preserve actual/forecast separation and fail closed to unavailable,
  not reintroduce forecast-as-actual. No database rollback is needed.
- Related contract: [Actual / Forecast Separation](ACTUAL_FORECAST_SEPARATION.md).
  This release supersedes the initial local-only checkpoint below.

Actual / forecast separation, local only (2026-09-20):

- Operational routes now select a valid/data month (`period`), using server time
  in Asia/Bangkok. Past/current months require actual; future months require an
  eligible operational forecast. No cross-family or latest-period substitution.
- Explicit `mapLayer=forecast-archive` retains rev03, source month T and T+1..T+6.
  Bare legacy `target=T&horizon=h` resolves valid month T+h. Missing archive origins
  remain unavailable. Existing archive Auth/RLS, values and Excel Cordia are unchanged.
- All geographic levels compose the same operational workspace from shared selects,
  metrics, disclosure and local map. A neutral unavailable map is not an actual
  classification renderer. Tambon still has no aggregate bar graph. Shared bookmarks
  follow areas independently of forecast filters and preserve explicit T+6 saves.
- Actual ingestion and operational forecast publication are **not connected**.
  No model-input fixture, report index, cleared research panel or upload timestamp
  is promoted into actual/as-issued forecast evidence. Source/metric/publication
  contracts and live adapters remain prerequisites.
- Verification from the implementation pass: 313 Vitest tests, 3 API tests, 9
  separation E2E cases (one duplicate tablet case skipped), plus 2 targeted bookmark
  rechecks passed. Samples cover province, two districts and two tambons on desktop/
  mobile, with a tablet case. Build/exposure checks passed, but the protected core
  bundle budget failed. Do not treat this as release-ready or raise limits silently.
- No commit, push, deploy, migration, production write or cross-task coordination
  occurred. Existing dirty work is preserved. Full legacy E2E intent migration,
  actual-feed UAT and production smoke remain unverified.
- Source audit, owner files, screenshots, exact bundle measurement and remaining
  gates: [Actual / Forecast Separation](ACTUAL_FORECAST_SEPARATION.md).
  Read it before continuing; older production checkpoints below do not imply this
  local change is deployed.

Global search production release (2026-09-14):

- Released formal-Thai global search across province/district/tambon names,
  aliases, codes and topics, with grouped contextual results, filters, exact or
  partial matching, and clearable per-account browser history. See
  [Search behavior](SEARCH_BEHAVIOR.md). Source month, lead time and irrigation
  context survive geographic navigation; the existing Excel dialog opens from search.
- Runtime `6c2dc5d54403cc507a414f92988473f1ac08a824`, build-budget follow-up
  `f3f8f6d784fb50ffda8fe4084fea00baeec8d0aa`, and navigation-test follow-up
  `f20803ce0f5bbb5b049da827b5951d638fd3e095` are pushed on
  `fix/nr-map-zoom-performance`. The last commit changes only the test's expected
  navigation entries; candidate runtime/build/config/data are identical.
- [Quality Gate](https://github.com/purichw/korattanphai/actions/runs/34809791172)
  passed all five jobs, including 79 database-browser cases. Local evidence also
  includes 24 focused unit/auth/route checks, 10 protected-build search cases and
  two updated static-provider shell cases across desktop/mobile.
- Promoted the same verified candidate `dpl_FkUCpZxxxpX5Y5EzvzhFE8r2Yq2t` /
  `https://korattanphai-o8txvojte-purichwc-1517s-projects.vercel.app`.
  Inspection confirms `https://korattanphai.vercel.app` serves this Ready artifact.
  Candidate and primary each passed 12 real-account desktop/mobile checks:
  on-demand loading, duplicate names, filters, exact destination context, history
  after reload, persistent clearing, Excel dialog, Escape and error-free requests.
- Built/deployed from a fresh tracked Git archive only. Unrelated pending map,
  report, loading, UAT, research and later shared-control edits remain unshipped.
  No forecast/geometry/API/auth changes, database migrations, production-data
  writes, billing changes or new paid services were part of this release.
- Search content loads only after opening the dialog (6,508 B gzip on production).
  Its limit is 25 kB gzip; the always-visible search shell has a documented 2 kB
  allowance, making the core cap 372 kB. Production core is 370,370 B and login
  118,452 B; existing login/map/SDK budgets remain unchanged. Node 24 protected
  builds pass exposure checks and emit no static archive in database mode.
- Evidence: `artifacts/search-release-20260914/`, including `verification.json`,
  `quality-final.json`, `candidate-smoke/`, `production-smoke/`, public HTTP and
  deployment inspection. Test-only local builds are not deployment artifacts.
  Physical-device testing was not performed; mobile checks use browser automation.
- Recovery: promote previous deployment `dpl_7hxc83Ya1pNNRsM2th89F4msMixq` /
  `https://korattanphai-g0r7luxo7-purichwc-1517s-projects.vercel.app` and smoke the
  primary alias. No database rollback is required.

Global search implementation, local only (2026-09-14):

- Added formal-Thai search across province/district/tambon identities and active
  pages/tools, following Shane Thai's grouped results, Contains/Exact, contextual
  labels, filters and explicitly committed recent searches. See `SEARCH_BEHAVIOR.md`.
- Recent searches are browser-local, per authenticated account, limited to six;
  clearing persists across reload without clearing other users' keys. No API or
  database storage was added. Existing scoped map search remains unchanged.
- Reuses `AppSelect`, `WorkspaceDialog` (optional `closeLabel`) and the existing
  Excel dialog (optional `openRequest`). Mobile filters start collapsed and all
  entry points restore keyboard focus. Geography navigation retains source
  month/lead time/irrigation, with Home still constrained to one month ahead.
- Verified 24 focused unit/auth/route tests and 8 desktop/mobile browser cases;
  reran the 4 affected browser cases after mobile filter refinement and the mobile
  menu-focus case after its fix. TypeScript and the isolated Vite build passed.
- Evidence: `artifacts/workspace-search-20260914/`. The builds use synthetic test
  auth configuration and are NOT deployment artifacts. No commit, push, deploy,
  hosted migration, production write, or full-site regression was performed.

Shared map tools, dynamic reports and loading production release (2026-09-14):

- Released Nakhon Ratchasima-only shared map search/coordinate lookup,
  six-horizon analysis, district comparison, same-target vintage comparison,
  risk patterns, playback and dynamically paginated A4 PNG/PDF reports.
  [Map tools](FORECAST_MAP_TOOLS.md) owns behavior, data boundaries and limits.
- Included the authorized startup/loading work from "โคราชทันภัย BE".
  No unrelated API UAT/research changes were included. The older local-only
  loading checkpoint below describes its original verification, now superseded
  by this combined release.
- Shared `AppSelect` owns product dropdowns, including analysis/report tools.
  Desktop menus and mobile sheets use consistent selection, nested Escape and
  focus restoration. Dialogs lock background scroll and work within fullscreen.
  Province/district map, chart, empty and loading frames share a stable height;
  status/legend space prevents irrigation filters from resizing the map.
- Runtime `e72fc201ce03151b56bbeae16b6b34a09afcc4d0` is pushed on
  `fix/nr-map-zoom-performance`. Quality commit
  `01d8f813f6b9f8ffa77630efd5c8005e8824c9d2` changes only two E2E test files
  after that runtime: reserved empty-status assertions and explicit geodata
  bootstrap readiness. The tested runtime/build/config/data are identical.
- [Quality Gate](https://github.com/purichw/korattanphai/actions/runs/34775293679)
  passed contracts, built-browser, database-browser, browser-compatibility and
  aggregate regression jobs. Targeted checks also exercised mouse/touch
  pan/zoom, dropdown scroll without camera movement, fullscreen, nested menus,
  modal scroll lock/focus restoration, and empty-filter reset across route levels.
- Built from clean archive `artifacts/map-loading-release-final-nXqhZj`,
  excluding unrelated working-tree files. Protected production build passed
  exposure checks and gzip budgets: core 369,431 B, login 117,515 B, lazy tools
  458,734 B. Supabase mode emits no static forecast archive; CSP is unchanged.
- Promoted verified deployment `dpl_7hxc83Ya1pNNRsM2th89F4msMixq` at
  `https://korattanphai-g0r7luxo7-purichwc-1517s-projects.vercel.app`.
  Primary inspection confirmed `https://korattanphai.vercel.app` serves it.
  Authenticated candidate and primary smoke each passed 32 existing checks plus
  14 map/loading checks. Evidence: gitignored
  `artifacts/forecast-map-tools/release/{verified-candidate,production}/`.
- Actual primary Excel export matched 1,734 values / 289 tambons / 32 district
  summaries; mobile district export matched 36 values / 6 tambons. Database
  projections, forecast/irrigation colors and blank-value semantics matched
  canonical rev03. No forecast data, geometry, API, auth or Supabase migrations
  changed; no production writes were performed.
- Primary PNG/PDF downloads and screenshots were inspected. Long Thai metadata
  and multi-page flow are covered by unit/browser stress tests. PDF is rasterized,
  not searchable text/vector GIS. Physical iOS/Android testing was not performed;
  mobile gestures use Chromium automation plus the existing compatibility suite.
- Previous production deployment remains the rollback target:
  `dpl_6Tui6Ae7R5ZHrmM8sQGzVnxQyTji` /
  `https://korattanphai-q7tf1zc1v-purichwc-1517s-projects.vercel.app`.

Cold-entry loading repair (2026-09-13, local only):

- The reported “กำลังเปิดโคราชทันภัย...” screen was the outer `App.tsx`
  Suspense fallback, shown after auth while the full `AuthenticatedApp` chunk
  downloaded. Existing archive skeletons could only appear after that chunk.
- Added an eager `AppStartup` with the shared sidebar brand and neutral Home
  skeleton; session checking outside `/login` also uses it. Heavy application
  imports and data access still wait for sign-in. Explicit login, denied access,
  redirect/session restoration and the failed-chunk recovery path remain intact.
- Split pure forecast loading presentation from the heavy drought header.
  Existing overview and drought loaders use the same primitives. No forecast
  values or user details appear in startup placeholders.
- Auth unit checks: 27 passed; existing forecast-loading unit checks: 10 passed.
  Browser evidence covers six startup cases, ten existing auth cases and eight
  existing data-loading cases across desktop/mobile. Initial mobile test failures
  were selector/timing issues: hidden toolbar placeholders and the transition
  between startup and data-loading skeletons. Corrected tests pass.
- Verified a protected build over HEAD `8501e40` plus the scoped startup files
  in `artifacts/startup-loading-20260913/isolated-source`; startup gzip 117,293 B
  remains below the 125,000 B budget. Exposure/chunk-reference checks passed.
  The shared checkout initially had a concurrent, unrelated TypeScript error
  in newly added `src/mapPoint.ts`; that work was preserved, not included in the
  isolated verification or repaired here.
- Screenshots/results live in `artifacts/startup-loading-20260913/`.
  Evidence uses local static data with mocked auth and held/failed chunk requests;
  it does not prove live network latency or Supabase integration. No commit,
  push, deployment, production data write, or whole-site regression was done.

Excel export upgrade production release (2026-09-09):

- Pushed runtime `1404e49d55c8ca2062e35baf01c9c8c8018dca7a` and test-runner
  follow-up `2b6bc4b12629aa9d2a352cd74372c0c112765923` on
  `fix/nr-map-zoom-performance`. Export now previews scope/revision before
  download, supports real worker cancellation and bounded generation, adds
  typed machine data and a TH/EN business dictionary, and compares different
  origin rounds by the same tambon and target month. Original seven sheets,
  native chart/Pivot parts and source-risk semantics remain intact.
- [Quality Gate](https://github.com/purichw/korattanphai/actions/runs/34346764768)
  passed all four jobs and the aggregate: 246 unit, 104 model-input/API/jobs,
  9 operations, 11 SQL/integrity/RLS, 135 built-browser cases (35 conditional
  skips), 41 database-browser cases (one mobile full-province duplicate skip),
  and 6 WebKit/Firefox cases. Dependency audit reported no vulnerabilities.
- The first CI run exposed a cold-cache Vite optimizer race: discovering lazy
  Excel worker dependencies replaced React modules under a concurrent retry
  test. The follow-up prebundles those three dependencies in the database test
  runner only. All assertions remain; five concurrent fresh-cache cases passed,
  then remote CI passed. Runtime/dependencies/build files are identical between
  the two commits, so the verified deployment artifact was reused.
- Built the production candidate from clean Git archive
  `artifacts/excel-release-2f9i8ezz`, excluding local artifacts and Python cache.
  Vercel protected build/exposure/bundle checks passed with Supabase configured
  and no static forecast archive assets. Promoted the verified candidate after
  CI passed: `dpl_6Tui6Ae7R5ZHrmM8sQGzVnxQyTji`,
  `https://korattanphai-q7tf1zc1v-purichwc-1517s-projects.vercel.app`.
  Primary-origin inspection confirms `https://korattanphai.vercel.app` serves
  that deployment and entry `index-cbf7ae1fc5.js`.
- Candidate and primary production each passed 32 authenticated desktop/mobile
  smoke checks plus seven hosted endpoint cases, with no failures. Real Excel
  downloads retain 1,734 source-equal province values and 36 district values.
  Supplemental desktop/mobile exports on both origins verify 36 typed machine
  rows, 30 same-target comparison pairs (60 source values), 82 dictionary
  definitions, fresh revision reads, and native chart/Pivot/OOXML relationships.
  Production desktop/mobile screenshots were reviewed.
- Evidence: `artifacts/excel-upgrade/release/metadata.json`,
  `quality-release.{json,log}`, `release-{candidate,production}/`,
  `comparison-live-2026-09-09T11-30-52-815Z/` (candidate), and
  `comparison-live-2026-09-09T11-52-37-287Z/` (production). Prior ONLYOFFICE
  reading/recalculation evidence and Microsoft Excel platform limits remain
  documented in [FORECAST_EXCEL_EXPORT.md](FORECAST_EXCEL_EXPORT.md).
- No migrations, application-data writes, canonical/geodata edits, or live-feed
  activation. Input/readiness remain unconfigured; telemetry remains off.
  Credentials and Vercel cookies were held in process memory only. Recovery:
  promote prior verified `dpl_CV1XnFCt3p3wgyaw1A252DtLAEkJ`, then smoke the
  primary origin; no database rollback is required.

Operational hardening production release (2026-09-09):

- Pushed runtime `abfa101233f6ccba87e78f2700c3b9a7b13a1ea8` and test-only
  follow-up `88512c9b993c0737c4ee40761279f23d28967ccf` on
  `fix/nr-map-zoom-performance`. The only follow-up difference is the forecast
  fault-injection test: it lets Vite's `?import&url` module load while holding
  the actual data fetch. Timeout/error/retry/selection assertions remain intact.
- [Quality Gate](https://github.com/purichw/korattanphai/actions/runs/34333473547)
  passed all four jobs and the `regression` aggregate on the follow-up commit:
  197 unit, 104 model-input/API/jobs, 9 operations, 11 SQL/integrity/RLS checks,
  135 built Chromium cases (31 conditional skips), 38 database-browser cases
  and 6 WebKit/Firefox cases. The first CI attempt exposed the Vite import
  interception issue and was superseded; it is not counted as a pass.
- Created the protected Supabase candidate from clean Git archive
  `artifacts/nfr-release-2ojt6rlh`, excluding the incidental Python cache and
  local artifacts. Vercel Node24 build/exposure/bundle checks passed with no
  static forecast archive assets. The tested follow-up has identical runtime,
  dependency, build and deployment files, so the verified artifact was reused.
- Deployment `dpl_CV1XnFCt3p3wgyaw1A252DtLAEkJ` is Ready at
  `https://korattanphai-438zljgad-purichwc-1517s-projects.vercel.app`.
  Promoted that exact artifact after CI and candidate verification. Direct
  deployment lookup and the alias listing confirm
  `https://korattanphai.vercel.app` resolves to this deployment.
- Candidate and primary production each passed 32 authenticated desktop/mobile
  smoke checks plus 7 hosted operational endpoint cases. Login/logout, scoped
  source equality, map colors, month/T+, irrigation/reset, saved reads, assets,
  security/cache headers and real Excel exports passed with no failures.
  Excel checks retained 1,734 source-equal values on desktop and 36 on mobile,
  including native chart/PivotTable parts. Desktop/mobile screenshots reviewed.
- Hosted status: public `/api/health` returns 200; invalid/method checks return
  their expected 400/405; private readiness returns 503 `not_configured`;
  `/api/model-inputs` returns 503 `service_not_configured`; disabled telemetry
  POST returns 204 and GET returns 405. These prove deployed handlers and
  disabled configuration boundaries, not an activated live data pipeline.
- Evidence is in `artifacts/nfr-regression/`: `release-metadata.json`,
  `quality-release.json`, `quality-release-full.log`, `deploy-candidate.json`,
  `production-inspection-confirmed.json`, and `release-{candidate,production}/`
  with `report.json`, `operational-endpoints.json` and screenshots.
- No migrations, live feed/scheduler, monitoring/recipient/log-store activation,
  forecast changes or application-data writes. Browser telemetry remains off.
  GitHub smoke secrets/variables are absent; preview-event smoke workflows were
  skipped and production verification used the local authorized harness.
  No passwords or Vercel session cookies were saved to source or reports.
- Recovery: promote prior verified `dpl_BmFJqbxy4eE66KdXiV16yxQCULV1`, then
  smoke the primary origin; no database rollback is required by this release.
  Field performance/SLA, physical-device/assistive-technology coverage,
  independent-connection capacity and whole-database restore remain unverified.

Local NFR implementation and regression (2026-09-09; not deployed):

- Added operational health/readiness, request IDs/log summaries, opt-in bounded
  browser telemetry, scoped integration identities, key rotation and durable
  quota SQL. Both opaque Supabase secret keys and legacy service-role JWTs are
  supported by server adapters. New migrations remain prepared, not applied.
- Added frozen resumable input jobs, deferred retries, source-specific freshness
  reports, source-scoped backup/local restore and report-only retention. Synthetic
  CLI restore retained exact receipts; this is not a whole-database recovery tool.
- Forecast and map loads now have 30-second deadlines and retry recovery; map
  retry preserves source month, T+ and selected area. Added skip navigation,
  compatibility cases and separate CI jobs with a stable `regression` aggregate.
- Local verification: 197 unit, 104 model-input, 9 operations, 11 SQL, 135 built
  Chromium cases (31 conditional skips), 38 isolated database-browser cases and
  6 selected WebKit/Firefox cases and 32 real-account checks against the new
  local protected Supabase build passed.
  Canonical/generated/geodata files (47) remain identical to HEAD.
- Current outcome, browser/performance evidence and limits are in
  [NFR_REGRESSION_2026-09-09.md](NFR_REGRESSION_2026-09-09.md). Operational activation,
  real source scheduling, log recipients, whole-database recovery and hosted
  verification follow [NFR_OPERATIONS_RUNBOOK.md](NFR_OPERATIONS_RUNBOOK.md).
- No commit, push, deploy, remote migration or application-data write in this
  checkpoint. Existing uncommitted integration work was preserved. The previous
  production release below remains the deployed state.

Exclusive forecast-action accordion release (2026-09-08):

- Pushed runtime `eabcefa3c54971fd78a7eb62ddf9df2af4f6cf19` on
  `fix/nr-map-zoom-performance`. This release includes only the six files for
  this task: shared operational/workspace components, styles, focused unit
  and browser tests, and shared-component documentation.
- Province/district action cards share `DroughtOperationalDisclosureGroup`:
  at most one section opens, the other two collapsed cards stay side by side
  above it, and the expanded section occupies the full row. Desktop/mobile,
  keyboard focus, close-all, mounted content and conditional item removal
  are covered. Subdistrict standalone guidance retains its existing behavior.
- [Quality Gate](https://github.com/purichw/korattanphai/actions/runs/34243218988)
  passed for the exact runtime commit: 185 unit tests, 11 isolated
  migration/integrity/RLS checks, 129 built-browser tests (31 conditional
  skips), 38 database-browser tests, protected builds, exposure/bundle limits
  and generated-data drift. The clean protected build also passed all six
  focused accordion browser cases locally. CI took 19m47s against its
  20-minute limit; no workflow changes are included in this release.
- Deployment used clean Git archive `artifacts/accordion-release-3tfjTc`,
  excluding unrelated working-tree changes. Verified Supabase Preview:
  `dpl_FgxAUauCp3ajd3og5TZDPf9WsU7m`,
  `https://korattanphai-mymdk1zye-purichwc-1517s-projects.vercel.app`.
  Preview received existing public browser Auth configuration per build;
  the automatic static-backend Preview was not used as release evidence.
- Production is Ready at `dpl_BmFJqbxy4eE66KdXiV16yxQCULV1`,
  `https://korattanphai-lv08sk5n0-purichwc-1517s-projects.vercel.app`.
  Deployment inspection confirms `https://korattanphai.vercel.app` points to
  this exact artifact with the Supabase backend and no static forecast assets.
- Preview and primary production each passed 32 authenticated smoke checks
  plus four province/district accordion checks across Chromium desktop/mobile.
  These verify exclusivity, the collapsed pair above the expanded card,
  keyboard focus, close-all, stable map dimensions and unchanged URLs.
  Existing checks retain login/logout, scoped RPC/source equality, map colors,
  month sync, percent/count charts, irrigation/empty/reset states, saved reads,
  assets/API/headers and no browser errors or horizontal overflow. Real Excel
  downloads retain 289 tambons, 32 district summaries and 1,734 source-equal
  values on desktop; mobile verifies six tambons, one district and 36 values,
  plus native chart/PivotTable parts.
- Evidence: `smoke-results/accordion-{preview,production}/report.json`,
  `accordion-report.json` and `*-{province,district}-attention-open.png`.
  No forecast/normalized changes, remote migrations, application-data writes,
  Auth/protection changes or credentials saved in reports. Unrelated pending
  model-input API, collection scripts, migration and configuration edits are
  deliberately uncommitted and excluded from the production snapshot.
- Limits: Chromium only; Safari, Firefox, physical devices and native Excel
  were not retested. Recovery: promote prior verified deployment
  `dpl_DLXCqgLHJvL46SyupsdkjnQ7Jrmr`; leave Supabase schema/data unchanged.

Combined irrigation-layout and forecast-terminology release (2026-09-08):

- Pushed runtime `5f1e62550cfd0eca75579eb5032f2c56bae3f005` and test-only
  follow-up `b7b40b5b9a467827de31c99e2633e7108605f457` on
  `fix/nr-map-zoom-performance`, combining the two authorized tasks. The
  follow-up only updates an obsolete archive-test tab selector to the new
  accessible label; all source-value and map-color assertions remain intact.
- Empty irrigation results now keep the district/province map in its existing
  desktop grid column instead of expanding across the chart. Overview and
  drought workspaces share `IrrigationEmptyState` and already share the map,
  month/status filters and irrigation selector. Their distinct outer layouts,
  subdistrict layout and mobile stacking remain intentional.
- Shared forecast labels use `ล่วงหน้า N เดือน`, with compact `N เดือน` tabs
  and chart axes. Mobile horizon dates consistently wrap month/year. Numeric
  horizons, forward-month calculations, source keys, URLs, user-authored saved
  names and Excel T+1-T+6 fields/formulas are unchanged.
- [Quality Gate](https://github.com/purichw/korattanphai/actions/runs/34238131931)
  passed for `b7b40b5`: 183 unit tests, 11 isolated migration/integrity/RLS
  checks, 123 built-browser tests (31 conditional skips), 38 database-browser
  tests, protected builds, exposure/bundle limits and generated-data drift.
  The corrected source-integrity browser spec also passed all eight cases
  locally against a protected build before the successful CI rerun.
- Clean Git archive candidate `dpl_DLXCqgLHJvL46SyupsdkjnQ7Jrmr` was built
  from `5f1e625` using Production settings and `--prod --skip-domain`.
  Candidate URL: `https://korattanphai-fsz1waxeh-purichwc-1517s-projects.vercel.app`.
  The later promotion request reported that this was already current
  production (409); deployment inspection and alias listing independently
  confirmed `https://korattanphai.vercel.app` points to this exact artifact.
  The test-only follow-up does not change deployed runtime bytes.
- Candidate and primary-production authenticated smoke each passed 32 checks
  on Chromium desktop/mobile. Coverage includes scoped RPC/source equality,
  map colors, month synchronization, percent/count charts, irrigation states
  and empty/reset frame stability across Overview/district/subdistrict,
  saved-workspace reads, login/logout, API/assets/headers, and no browser
  errors or horizontal overflow. Real Excel downloads verify 289 tambons,
  32 district summaries and 1,734 source-equal values on desktop; mobile
  verifies six tambons, one district and 36 values, plus chart/PivotTable parts.
- Evidence: `smoke-results/irrigation-terminology-{candidate,production}/report.json`
  and screenshots, including `desktop-empty-irrigation-district.png` and
  `mobile-empty-irrigation-district.png`. No forecast/normalized edits, remote
  migration, application-data writes or Auth/protection changes. Credentials
  and deployment-access cookies are not saved in reports. Unrelated
  `scripts/__pycache__/` remains untouched and uncommitted.
- Limits: Chromium only; Safari, Firefox, physical devices and native Excel
  were not retested. Recovery: promote previous verified deployment
  `dpl_2ssjqfeeLknkTUxL9Fi3Ud1YULfs`, without changing Supabase schema/data.

Inline forecast month-loading production release (2026-09-08):

- Pushed and released runtime `e6611d95e312379d219a4075db3f540a79ef2786`
  on `fix/nr-map-zoom-performance`. Only the month-loading UI, shared-component
  documentation and focused regressions changed; unrelated lock/cache files
  remain untouched and uncommitted.
- Shared `ForecastMonthSelect` shows an in-place spinner in page/map month
  controls, including the Home mobile editor. The long top paragraph is now
  an assistive-technology announcement outside the busy content. Loaded dates,
  map and metrics stay synchronized until success; late responses, retry,
  reduced motion and background Supabase revision checks remain supported.
- [Quality Gate](https://github.com/purichw/korattanphai/actions/runs/34220940871)
  passed for the exact runtime commit: 177 unit tests, isolated database checks,
  109 built-browser tests (31 conditional skips), 38 database-browser tests,
  protected builds, exposure/bundle limits and generated-data drift checks.
  The unchanged local implementation also passed 12 focused unit/lifecycle
  tests and 10 desktop/mobile scoped-loading browser tests before release.
- Built clean Git archive candidate `dpl_2ssjqfeeLknkTUxL9Fi3Ud1YULfs` with
  Production settings and `--prod --skip-domain`, then promoted that same
  artifact after CI and candidate smoke passed. Primary alias inspection
  confirms `https://korattanphai.vercel.app` serves this deployment.
  Candidate: `https://korattanphai-3hohrvn3z-purichwc-1517s-projects.vercel.app`.
- Candidate and production each passed 28 existing authenticated smoke checks
  plus four targeted Home/district month-change checks across desktop/mobile.
  Targeted checks delay only delivery of an unchanged, source-equal live
  Supabase response: no heading movement, old values/colors retained while
  pending, and spinner/announcement cleared once the new month is loaded.
  Full smoke retains five route scopes, source-equal map/RPC/Excel checks,
  login/logout, irrigation, saved-workspace reads, assets/API/headers and
  no browser errors or horizontal overflow.
- Evidence: `smoke-results/month-loading-{candidate,production}/report.json`,
  `month-loading-report.json`, and `*-home-pending.png` / `*-district-pending.png`.
  No forecast/normalized changes, migrations, application-data writes,
  credentials in reports, or Auth/protection-setting changes. Chromium only;
  Safari, Firefox and physical devices were not retested for this UI release.
  Recovery: promote previous verified deployment
  `dpl_GvGMGxBQEKgn74xbmwvdhDWhnKjy`; leave Supabase schema/data unchanged.

Forecast Excel export and overview cleanup production release (2026-09-07):

- Released runtime `ccf506c0b2a382e7a69281e1258f3dc0bf18b21c` and pushed
  `e7ced247e9aa5f3eff58a74dd65399e6a6aaac86` on
  `fix/nr-map-zoom-performance`. The latter updates only an obsolete test
  expecting a derived-readiness badge; it now requires absent readiness UI
  and all four real-forecast provenance indicators. Runtime bytes are unchanged.
- Combined both tasks: shared filtered Excel export with district/tambon
  T+1-T+6, editable native charts/PivotTable and traceable provenance; removal
  of supporting-readiness UI/map actions/loading slots; clearer Home empty
  attention state and summary-heading forecast navigation without duplicate
  archive cards. Forecast values, irrigation rules and geometry are unchanged.
- [Quality Gate](https://github.com/purichw/korattanphai/actions/runs/34126361083)
  passed: 175 unit tests, 11 isolated migration/integrity/RLS checks, 109
  built-browser tests (31 conditional skips), 38 database-browser tests,
  protected builds, exposure/bundle budgets and generated-data drift checks.
  Local tests exclude ignored `artifacts/**` and `tmp-snapshots/**` copies;
  no product test is omitted by that exclusion.
- Candidate `dpl_GvGMGxBQEKgn74xbmwvdhDWhnKjy` was built from a clean Git
  archive of `ccf506c` with Production settings and `--prod --skip-domain`.
  After candidate smoke and passing CI, the same artifact was promoted to
  `https://korattanphai.vercel.app`; alias inspection confirms this deployment.
  Candidate URL: `https://korattanphai-c5t8t0qbj-purichwc-1517s-projects.vercel.app`.
- Authenticated candidate and production smoke both passed on desktop/mobile:
  five route scopes, source-equal scoped RPCs and map colors, forward months,
  chart units, irrigation, unavailable states, saved-workspace reads,
  login/logout, API/assets/security headers and no overflow/browser errors.
  Real downloads contain 32 districts/289 tambons/1,734 source-equal values
  on desktop and one district/six tambons/36 values on mobile, with district
  maximum-risk summaries, chart/PivotTable parts and dataset provenance.
  Evidence: `smoke-results/excel-overview-{candidate,production}/report.json`.
- No remote migration, forecast/normalized edits, application-data writes or
  Auth/protection-setting changes. Candidate smoke used the project's existing
  authorized automation access; credentials/cookies were not saved in reports.
  Spreadsheet lock and Python cache files remain untouched and uncommitted.
- Residual limits: Chromium only, not Safari/Firefox/physical devices; native
  Microsoft Excel was not available (ONLYOFFICE was exercised during feature
  development). Pivot may require Refresh All. The pinned ExcelJS fork's uuid
  dependency retains a moderate advisory outside the v4-only paths used here;
  see `FORECAST_EXCEL_EXPORT.md`. Recovery: promote previous verified deployment
  `dpl_B477wzpSX4kBhxVgcJCriFbfzCF1`, without changing Supabase schema/data.

Overview map month and bookmark production release (2026-09-07):

- Pushed runtime `7e7f3ecc5b3dd6f820c8ab2795ac67a0eb095269` on
  `fix/nr-map-zoom-performance`. `05bf09b` narrows the existing Home test's
  month selector; runtime, data and deployment configuration are identical.
- Home enables the existing shared map month dropdown, synchronized with the
  top filter, URL and T+1 summary. Included the concurrent bookmark redesign:
  shared buttons, fixed dialog header/tabs, internal scrolling, empty/error
  states, inline delete confirmation and restored focus on close.
- [Quality Gate](https://github.com/purichw/korattanphai/actions/runs/34119431352)
  passed: 171 unit tests, isolated database/RLS checks, 109 built-browser tests
  (27 conditional skips), 34 database-browser tests, protected builds,
  exposure/bundle budgets and generated-data drift checks. Local targeted
  desktop/mobile flows also passed, including mocked bookmark writes.
- Built clean commit archive `7e7f3ec` using Production settings with
  `--prod --skip-domain`. After candidate smoke and CI, promoted the same
  artifact without rebuilding. Production alias inspection confirms
  `dpl_B477wzpSX4kBhxVgcJCriFbfzCF1` at
  `https://korattanphai-9c7y4x9ca-purichwc-1517s-projects.vercel.app`.
- Authenticated candidate and production smoke passed on desktop/mobile:
  month synchronization both ways, bookmark reads/keyboard/focus, five route
  scopes, source-equal scoped RPCs/map colors, chart units, irrigation and
  unavailable states, login/logout, assets/API/security headers and overflow.
  Evidence: `smoke-results/combined-ui-{candidate,production}/report.json`,
  `*-overview-month-filter.png` and `*-saved-filters.png`.
- No Supabase migrations, application-data writes, auth changes or forecast
  data edits. New in-progress work started during CI remains uncommitted and
  was not included; spreadsheet lock and Python cache files remain untouched.
  Chromium only; Safari/Firefox/physical devices were not checked.
- Recovery: promote previous verified deployment
  `dpl_61UY2UeoW9vKE4bMofVvuof1SXDn`; leave Supabase data/schema unchanged.

Shared forecast bar graph production release (2026-09-07):

- Pushed runtime `b96340fc35a65403b3076219375babccca68ef6f` on
  `fix/nr-map-zoom-performance`. `f7ef591` corrects the loading test for static
  versus database providers; runtime/data/configuration match `b96340f` exactly.
- Province and every district reuse `ForecastRiskBarGraph.tsx` through
  `DroughtForecastWorkspaceChart`. Full-width percent/count controls, readable
  six-horizon labels, four-item responsive legend, coverage strip and
  hover/focus/tap details follow the supplied desktop/mobile references.
  Subdistricts still omit the population chart. Risk/date/denominator semantics,
  map state and archive values are unchanged.
- [Quality Gate](https://github.com/purichw/korattanphai/actions/runs/34116923885)
  passed for `f7ef591`: 171 unit tests, isolated database/integrity/RLS checks,
  109 built-browser tests (23 conditional skips), 30 database-browser tests,
  protected builds, exposure/bundle budgets and generated-data drift checks.
  Local chart evidence also covers all six requested desktop/mobile sizes.
- Candidate `dpl_61UY2UeoW9vKE4bMofVvuof1SXDn` was built from a clean archive of
  `b96340f`, using Production settings and `--prod --skip-domain`. After CI and
  authenticated candidate smoke, the same artifact was promoted without a
  rebuild to `https://korattanphai.vercel.app`. Verified deployment URL:
  `https://korattanphai-mniipewgq-purichwc-1517s-projects.vercel.app`.
- Candidate and production real-account smoke passed on desktop/mobile:
  login/logout, five route scopes, source-equal scoped RPCs and map colors,
  chart units, all-null handling, irrigation/reload/reset, saved-workspace
  reads, assets/API/headers and no overflow or page errors. Additional Soeng
  Sang checks confirm the new legend and keyboard/touch detail behavior.
- Evidence: `smoke-results/bar-graph-{candidate,production}/report.json`,
  `shared-chart-report.json`, and `desktop-shared-chart.png` /
  `mobile-shared-chart.png`. Local reference comparison:
  `artifacts/bar-graph-v1/reference-development.png`.
- No remote migration, application-data writes, Auth settings or normalized
  source changes. Concurrent uncommitted bookmark design changes and the
  existing spreadsheet lock/Python cache were excluded from this release.
  Chromium only; Safari/Firefox/physical devices were not checked. The existing
  large-chunk advisory remains within the enforced budget.
- Recovery: promote `dpl_BtffbjmaXRzBPLNt1Wffp9R7W7gX`, the previous verified
  combined forecast release. Keep Supabase schema/datasets unchanged.

Subdistrict inspection workspace production release (2026-09-07):

- Released runtime `ccd04d75dd842e64ade37bda2cd39ef18413209e` after the separate
  Rev03 deployment finished and its production smoke passed. The base includes
  `d8286dd`, `8b149dc` and the cutover documentation `fffe3c9`; see
  `docs/DROUGHT_REV03_CUTOVER.md`. No new remote migration or data writes here.
- Subdistrict desktop/tablet now use a dominant map and result/context/guidance
  rail. The context card stretches so collapsed guidance ends exactly at the
  map bottom. Mobile stacks the same shared components. Six T+ tabs fill the
  intro width; duplicate page/map month and page/strip horizon controls remain
  intentionally synchronized. Forward T+ semantics and Rev03 values are intact.
- Single-area map fitting opts into a geometry-bounded 28x maximum and readable
  labels. Other scopes retain 7.2x. The existing renderer, irrigation controls,
  account/bookmarks and navigation remain; neutral loading follows the layout.
- Local gate: 160 unit tests, 37 targeted desktop/mobile browser tests (one
  duplicate matrix skip), ten responsive sizes, protected Supabase build,
  exposure/bundle checks and no generated-data drift passed. Exact-commit CI
  passed every required step, including both built-browser suites and isolated
  migration/RLS checks: https://github.com/purichw/korattanphai/actions/runs/34047516946 .
- Candidate `dpl_ufZBassRXtWfk7i3UVoeqeG5GbFD` was built from clean detached
  source `artifacts/subdistrict-v2/release-ccd04d7/` with real Production settings
  and `--prod --skip-domain`. After CI and endpoint checks, the same artifact was
  promoted to `https://korattanphai.vercel.app`. Deployment URL:
  `https://korattanphai-acbri7qqw-purichwc-1517s-projects.vercel.app`.
- Candidate and public endpoint checks each passed 11 resources: HTML, all
  three JS/two CSS chunks, backend marker, three geometry files and API. Public
  bytes match the candidate; CSP/MIME/cache headers pass and backend remains
  Supabase without static forecast assets. Reports are in
  `artifacts/subdistrict-v2/{candidate,production}-endpoints.json`.
- Real production Chrome used the existing authenticated session. All six
  horizons retain the source month and synchronize the dropdown/context; map
  category totals match Rev03 and the selected area's risks are 1/1/1/2/2/2.
  Home-key selection and Enter/Space guidance toggling passed. Desktop 1440x900,
  tablet 768x1024 and mobile 390x844 have no horizontal overflow. Map/guidance
  bottoms match exactly: 877.992px desktop and 1089.281px tablet. Desktop and
  mobile screenshots were inspected inline; browser error logs were empty.
- No fresh password login, live bookmark writes/restoration, Safari or physical
  device checks in this UI release. Auth/bookmarks have isolated CI coverage;
  previous Rev03 real-account smoke is recorded separately. Unrelated rollback
  notes, spreadsheet lock and Python cache files remain uncommitted/excluded.
  Recovery deployment is the verified Rev03 release
  `dpl_J9kqETDCpFdFaD1AcSFigN81cGvW`; preserve its schema and immutable dataset.

Forward forecast semantics and UI terminology production release (2026-09-06):

- Released runtime `8cfa2824f81b9bb886b7479ef9d36a0c6dbcdf41` to
  `https://korattanphai.vercel.app`; pushed `fix/nr-map-zoom-performance`
  without merging `main`.
- The user confirmed that Excel `Source_YearMonth` is origin T for every
  source month, including June 2015. Runtime `issueMonth = T` and
  `targetMonth = T + horizon`: June 2015 forecasts July-December 2015;
  December 2025 forecasts January-June 2026. This supersedes the previous
  fixed-target/backwards-reference product convention below. The original
  normalized workbook's `UNCONFIRMED` marker remains historical provenance.
- `src/forecastPeriod.ts` owns shared calendar-month arithmetic;
  `forecastModel.ts` projects dates for Home, province, district, subdistrict,
  graphs and maps. UI consistently distinguishes `เดือนตั้งต้น (T)` from
  `เดือนที่พยากรณ์`, including filters, map previews, loading placeholders,
  guidance, and saved-selection descriptions. The final copy follow-up removes
  `พยากรณ์` from T+ tab subtitles, leaving only the forward month/year.
- Immutable canonical/generated JSON and published database/RPC payloads are
  unchanged. Legacy `targetMonths`, `packedRiskByTargetMonth`, URL `target`,
  and saved `target_period` still identify the source row T. Old saved links
  retain the same source/horizon/risk while displaying forward dates. No data
  migration is needed. Active contracts are updated in DATA_CONTRACT,
  ARCHITECTURE, APP_MAP, SHARED_COMPONENTS and SUPABASE_DATA_MIGRATION.
- Local gate: 154 unit tests, a fresh protected build and 16 built-browser
  drought-workspace checks passed after the final tab-copy change. Tests cover
  preservation of all 220,218 source/horizon/subdistrict values across 127
  months. Exact-runtime Quality Gate
  `https://github.com/purichw/korattanphai/actions/runs/34037950815` passed:
  154 unit tests, 10 isolated migration/integrity/RLS checks, both protected
  static and Supabase builds, 90 built-browser tests (10 conditional skips),
  four database UI tests, exposure/bundle guards and no generated-data drift.
  The existing Vite chunk-size advisory remains within enforced budgets.
- Deployment `dpl_CNfArLjRBvsG2kX5Bjx2hSVX9RAK` came from a clean detached
  checkout (227 uploaded source files), used the actual production Supabase
  configuration, and was promoted unchanged after candidate checks and CI.
  Deployment URL:
  `https://korattanphai-eytyko48m-purichwc-1517s-projects.vercel.app`.
  Candidate and public production each passed 10 endpoint checks with matching
  bytes/hashes, MIME types, CSP and cache headers. The backend marker remains
  Supabase; no static forecast archive assets or source maps were emitted.
- Real production Chrome checks used an existing authenticated session:
  Home T+1, province Dec-2025/T+6 and Jun-2015/T+6, and subdistrict
  Dec-2025/T+4 all showed forward dates. All 289 map risk colors matched the
  canonical source/horizon values in each checked state. The month selector
  offered 127 origins back to June 2015; saved-filter descriptions used forward
  dates. Desktop and true 390px mobile screenshots were inspected, with no
  horizontal overflow or browser errors.
- Evidence: `tmp-snapshots/forward-forecast-release-e2e-20260906/`,
  `tmp-snapshots/forward-forecast-candidate-check-20260906/report.json`,
  `tmp-snapshots/forward-forecast-production-check-20260906/report.json`, and
  `tmp-snapshots/forward-forecast-production-ui-20260906/report.json`.
  Production screenshots include `desktop-subdistrict-dec2025-t4.png`,
  `desktop-june2015-t6.png` and
  `mobile-subdistrict-dec2025-t4-verified.png` in the production UI directory.
  The initial mobile capture retained a desktop viewport and is excluded from
  evidence; the verified capture confirms a settled 390px viewport.
- No fresh password login was exercised for this release. The signed-in
  account had no saved filters, so live restoration was not exercised; isolated
  database UI tests cover restoration. No application-data writes, auth/schema
  changes, remote migrations, Safari, physical-device or load tests. Recovery
  deployment: `dpl_xXNKf2hDWCYGu8e3TktWCQHSnLTJ` (runtime `922e28a`).

Shared operational-card alignment production release (2026-09-06):

- Released runtime `922e28aef6e62f0a531ba47bda6efee80285d739` to
  `https://korattanphai.vercel.app`; pushed `fix/nr-map-zoom-performance`
  without merging `main`. Includes the preceding subdistrict-card colors.
  `DroughtOperationalSummary` reuses `MetricCard`; it and the existing native
  disclosure share a centered heading layout across applicable drought scopes.
  Short copy centers on both axes; long header descriptions can opt into start
  alignment, and expanded prose stays start-aligned. Counts, unavailable states,
  navigation, keyboard toggling and focus behavior are unchanged.
- Local gate: 151 unit tests passed, reusing the current-source build and eight
  targeted browser checks plus desktop/tablet/mobile visual geometry evidence.
  Exact-runtime Quality Gate `34034466561` passed: 151 unit tests, isolated
  database checks, 86 built-browser checks (10 conditional skips), four database
  UI checks, both protected builds, exposure/bundle guards and no generated-data
  drift. The existing Vite chunk-size advisory remains; bundle budgets pass.
- Deployment `dpl_xXNKf2hDWCYGu8e3TktWCQHSnLTJ` came from a clean detached
  checkout (226 uploaded source files), was verified as a production-config
  candidate, then promoted unchanged. Deployment URL:
  `https://korattanphai-pa5asyxg9-purichwc-1517s-projects.vercel.app`.
  Public entry `index-d3fcf64c1c.js`, main CSS `index-DgUoUktb.css`, loading CSS
  `AuthenticatedApp-Ca5_jlRf.css` and `data-backend.json` returned HTTP 200.
  The backend marker is Supabase; no static forecast archive assets were emitted.
- Fresh real-account candidate and public smoke each passed 20 checks across
  five desktop/mobile routes, irrigation filters/reset/reload and saved-workspace
  reads. The actual full/T+1 RPC payloads match the canonical Excel archive;
  map colors/counts match source, and there is no static fallback. Each run
  recorded 30 successful RPC/workspace reads and no browser errors. Additional
  deployed assertions verified centered card copy, Enter/Space toggling,
  retained focus/URL and start-aligned expanded guidance. Desktop/mobile and
  expanded-guidance screenshots were visually inspected.
- Evidence: `tmp-snapshots/operational-cards-centered-20260906/`,
  `smoke-results/operational-cards-candidate-verified-20260906/`
  (2026-09-06T12:56:55.246Z) and
  `smoke-results/operational-cards-production-20260906/`
  (2026-09-06T13:06:24.339Z). Initial temporary diagnostics needed correction:
  the desktop wrapper uses `display: contents`, so screenshot crops use its
  visible children; the backend marker key is `backend`, not `provider`.
  Both probes passed after matching the existing contracts, with no app edits
  or weakened behavior assertions. The first candidate report is retained.
- No auth settings, schema, migrations or application-data writes. No Safari,
  physical-device or load tests; full local E2E was not duplicated because CI
  covered the exact runtime. Recovery artifact:
  `dpl_3QjrznVqYQFLRTEWHpoxujhJTJH7`.

Subdistrict forecast-card colors production release (2026-09-06):

- Released runtime `dfc25ee0f0ac5889e6f1e0741fc583f317e04c02` to
  `https://korattanphai.vercel.app`; pushed `fix/nr-map-zoom-performance`
  without merging `main`. The single subdistrict forecast card now uses
  green/amber/red surfaces for no-risk/moderate/high, neutral gray for
  out-of-scope, and a dashed neutral border for missing records. Status text,
  icons and provenance remain explicit; aggregate cards are unchanged.
- Local gate: 147 unit tests, protected build/typecheck/exposure/bundle guards,
  unchanged generated data, and 12 built drought-workspace browser checks
  passed. Earlier targeted visual checks covered all five states and mobile.
  Exact-runtime Quality Gate `34033707957` passed: 147 unit tests, isolated
  database checks, 86 built-browser checks (10 conditional skips), four
  database UI checks and both protected builds.
- Deployment `dpl_3QjrznVqYQFLRTEWHpoxujhJTJH7` was built from a clean
  detached checkout (226 uploaded source files), checked as a production-config
  candidate, then promoted unchanged. Candidate/public checks confirmed
  the expected CSS palette, headers, geodata, read-only API and Supabase mode.
  Public entry: `index-328ce87869.js`; main CSS: `index-dne0t-rj.css`;
  authenticated app: `AuthenticatedApp-b4d0d1bb7b.js`. No static forecast
  archive assets were emitted.
- Fresh public UI inspection used the existing authenticated Chrome session
  in a separate tab: desktop 1440x960 showed the high-risk red card; selecting
  T+1 changed the status to moderate, and mobile 390x844 showed the amber card
  fitting the page. Screenshots were inspected in the task, and captured browser
  error logs were empty. The existing user tab/session was preserved and the
  temporary viewport was reset. The browser tool's computed-style selector
  reads timed out after reload, so deployed visual proof uses its successful
  native screenshots/AX reads plus the exact served CSS; local computed-style
  checks remain in the five-state evidence.
- Evidence: `tmp-snapshots/subdistrict-forecast-colors-20260906/`,
  `tmp-snapshots/release-forecast-colors-e2e-20260906/`,
  `smoke-results/forecast-colors-candidate-20260906/report.json` and
  `smoke-results/forecast-colors-production-20260906/assets-report.json`.
  The full fresh-login smoke harness was not rerun: this task had no supplied
  smoke password, so public UI verification used the existing logged-in browser.
  No auth settings, schema, data writes, physical-device or Safari tests.
- Recovery artifact: `dpl_ANiaDLyVAHN3LNnsvsyTEBfRgHMQ`. New concurrent
  local edits appeared after the release checkout was frozen; they were left
  intact and are not included in runtime `dfc25ee` or this release evidence.

Combined loading and compact UI production release (2026-09-06):

- Released runtime `cf522816bfd49309ea03792f7c51a30c1e16377c`, including all
  work confirmed at the task 2/3/4 release freeze: equal map dropdowns, shared
  route-aware loading/error UI, smaller T+ labels, and removal of subdistrict
  supporting-data readiness. Pushed `fix/nr-map-zoom-performance`; no main merge.
- Quality Gate `34032847073` passed for that exact commit: 147 unit tests,
  isolated database tests, 86 built-browser checks (10 conditional skips), 4
  database UI checks, both protected builds, exposure/bundle guards and no
  generated-data drift.
- Built from a clean detached checkout (226 source files, no local artifacts
  or credentials uploaded). Production-config candidate
  `dpl_ANiaDLyVAHN3LNnsvsyTEBfRgHMQ` was verified before promoting the same
  artifact to `https://korattanphai.vercel.app`. Deployment URL:
  `https://korattanphai-l663tcia8-purichwc-1517s-projects.vercel.app`.
  Public entry `index-0a68bf2664.js`, main CSS `index-rNBiO4qe.css`, loading
  CSS `AuthenticatedApp-Ca5_jlRf.css`, and `data-backend.json` all returned
  HTTP 200 with the expected Supabase mode. No static forecast assets emitted.
- Real-account candidate and public production smoke passed 20 checks each:
  five routes on desktop/mobile, all source-matched map colors/counts, three
  irrigation categories, empty-filter/reset, saved-workspace reads, no static
  fallback, valid assets and no overflow. Each run recorded 30 successful
  RPC/personal-workspace reads and no browser errors. Held real RPC requests
  additionally verified the deployed Home desktop and drought mobile loading
  layout; actual T+ sizes and absent subdistrict readiness were asserted.
- Evidence: `smoke-results/combined-release-candidate-verified-20260906/`
  (2026-09-06T12:24:13.096Z) and
  `smoke-results/combined-release-production-20260906/`
  (2026-09-06T12:32:26.592Z). Screenshots were visually reviewed. The first
  candidate diagnostic attempt had a request-release race in temporary
  screenshot instrumentation; fixed its cleanup ordering before the successful
  rerun, without changing app code or smoke assertions.
- Read-only archive integrity evidence is recorded below. No auth settings,
  schema, migrations or application-data writes. Physical-device, Safari and
  load tests were not run. Recovery artifact:
  `dpl_4DWNAUdkYi6kCWyiBhsES4E5aubr`.
- A NEW task 4 request after the freeze added subdistrict forecast-card colors
  locally in `DroughtForecastWorkspace.tsx`, `drought-workspace.css`, and the
  corresponding `SHARED_COMPONENTS.md` entry. Its owner confirmed this later
  scope is complete locally but not committed/deployed. Those edits are
  preserved, intentionally excluded from this verified runtime and closeout
  commit; do not describe them as present in production.

Combined loading and compact UI release preparation (2026-09-06):

- The user authorized pushing/deploying all pending work from Korat tasks 2,
  3 and 4. Their owners confirmed the scope and stopped concurrent edits.
  Includes the already-deployed, unpushed `f9865d1` map dropdown change, the
  shared loading UI below, removal of supporting-data readiness only from the
  subdistrict view, and smaller T+ labels (14px desktop, 13px mobile). Loading
  labels now match those ready-state sizes. Shared readiness components and
  Home/province/district readiness remain intact.
- Local combined gate: 147 unit tests, protected static build/exposure/bundle
  checks, unchanged generated data, and 38 built desktop/mobile/tablet E2E
  scenarios passed. Evidence: `tmp-snapshots/combined-release-e2e-final-20260906/`.
  Initial run had 37 passes and a map-color assertion during the 140ms fill
  transition; trace confirmed the early read. The assertion now polls the
  same exact colors for every polygon; no expected values were relaxed.
- Read-only real-account verification at 2026-09-06T12:17:51.448Z confirmed
  the only published dataset, original/normalized/canonical hashes, exact T+1
  and T+1-T+6 RPC projections, all 220,218 source values and denied anonymous
  access. Evidence: `smoke-results/database-integrity/report.json`.
- No auth/schema/data writes or migrations. CI, candidate verification and
  production promotion remain pending at this preparation checkpoint. Previous
  good artifact: `dpl_4DWNAUdkYi6kCWyiBhsES4E5aubr`.

Shared forecast loading UI (2026-09-06, local work; not deployed):

- Home, province drought, district and subdistrict now compose
  `ForecastOverviewLoading` / `DroughtWorkspaceLoading` from
  `ForecastArchiveLoading.tsx`. Route identity/back navigation remain visible;
  neutral skeletons follow each route's desktop/mobile layout. Subdistrict has
  one status placeholder and no population chart or attention list.
- One accessible loading announcement, reduced-motion support, and shared
  compact failure/retry state replace the sparse full-page loading messages.
  No forecast values, risk colors, map geometry or selected-area assumptions are
  fabricated during loading. Auth, requests, caches, archive validation and
  Supabase/database data are unchanged.
- Verification: build, 31 focused unit tests (excluding ignored release
  checkouts), and 18 desktop/mobile loading E2E checks passed. Held/failed
  requests prove pending/ready/error/retry and leaving/returning while pending;
  retry preserves target/T+, and heading positions remain stable. Final images
  and capture context: `smoke-results/forecast-loading/`.
- No push/deploy, production data writes, full release suite, physical-device
  or load testing was requested for this UI pass. Local authenticated preview
  uses `http://127.0.0.1:5176`; the test-only server on port 5178 was stopped
  after verification.

Equal-width Home map dropdown follow-up (2026-09-06, deployed separately):

- Runtime `f9865d1` changes the shared single-filter map rail to equal `1fr`
  columns with its existing 32px reset column. This local commit is still ahead
  of the remote branch; the release owner deployed without pushing.
- Clean deployment `dpl_4DWNAUdkYi6kCWyiBhsES4E5aubr` is Ready on the public
  alias, with `index-eb04ae25bc.js` / `index-BVO-2F5g.css`. The loading UI above
  is not included. Candidate evidence:
  `smoke-results/equal-map-dropdowns-candidate-ready/report.json`.
- Targeted real-account checks passed default/unknown/rainfed on desktop and
  mobile: desktop fields both 331.421875x38px, mobile stacking preserved, no
  reset overlap or horizontal overflow, unchanged URL and no browser errors.
  The first attempt used a short 5s readiness assertion; the bounded 30s check
  passed with HTTP 200 RPC reads. This CSS-only release did not rerun the full
  archive/database suite or change Supabase. Recovery is the prior good
  `dpl_4h4XtWn25ATQWhVZ32cuoi4HR1aQ` artifact.

In-map irrigation controls production release (2026-09-06):

- Runtime `b4fcc194136e46a134e5d2de5fda77e7a6ccd184` is pushed to
  `fix/nr-map-zoom-performance`, without merging `main`. Shared irrigation
  controls now live inside the map on Home, province, district and subdistrict
  views. Selection filters the whole workspace without changing the URL or
  history length; reload, explicit area navigation and saved filters retain it.
  Map encoding uses blue/purple/gray for irrigation metadata, independently of
  the unchanged drought risk values and chart colors.
- Exact-commit Quality Gate `34022249917` passed: 139 unit tests, 10 isolated
  database checks, 76 built browser tests (10 conditional skips), four database
  UI tests, both protected builds, exposure/bundle checks and generated-data
  drift checks. The follow-up fixes an obsolete top-filter test selector and
  preserves mobile Home plot height after moving the controls into the map.
- Deployment `dpl_4h4XtWn25ATQWhVZ32cuoi4HR1aQ`
  (`https://korattanphai-imtjgzzqh-purichwc-1517s-projects.vercel.app`) was
  built from a clean detached checkout of that runtime with Production
  configuration. Candidate smoke passed before promoting the same artifact.
  The public alias confirms this Ready deployment, `/assets/index-7e6dd13fdd.js`
  and backend `supabase`.
- Real-account candidate and public production smoke both passed all 20 check
  entries across desktop/mobile: five base routes, exact irrigation source
  groups 20/97/172 and colors, whole-page risk counts, unchanged URL/history,
  reload, empty/reset, both actual archive RPC projections, saved reads,
  login/logout, assets/headers and no static fallback. Evidence:
  `smoke-results/irrigation-map-candidate-clean-verified/report.json` and
  `smoke-results/irrigation-map-production/report.json`; both have zero failures.
  Production evidence is dated 2026-09-06 09:49:45 UTC. All 30 tracked production
  RPC/saved requests finished HTTP 200, with no browser or visible UI errors.
  Fresh desktop/mobile production screenshots were inspected at scroll zero.
- Earlier candidate runs recorded saved-read/map-wait failures and intermittent
  `ERR_CONNECTION_CLOSED` from Supabase. Those reports remain preserved. A
  bounded Node/Chromium transport diagnostic subsequently returned the exact
  full archive, followed by passing full candidate and production runs. No
  assertions, timeouts or production settings were weakened to pass the gate.
- Release hygiene: do not deploy from a worktree containing ignored test
  artifacts. Earlier unpromoted candidates included them as private build
  source; filename inspection found no actual `.env` files. The promoted clean
  deployment contains no `tmp-snapshots`, `smoke-results`, test output or actual
  `.env` files in its uploaded source. Use a clean checkout for future releases.
- No archive, SQL migration, Auth, RLS, dependency or environment changes were
  made in this release; concurrent migration work was left intact. Recovery:
  promote previous good deployment `dpl_Eo1sitfh7j4nBT6AJvagFg1VJn9j`, leaving
  Supabase and personal records intact. Physical Safari, load/SLO testing and
  live personal-record writes were not run. Only documentation closeout follows
  the deployed runtime.

Irrigation status filter production release (2026-09-05):

- Runtime `bd3edcd96e1acc34ad8fd0201886cb8aae41635a` and test-only follow-up
  `7d0b69dca2c4c76c8690120b3bf50c6e30d3fc69` are pushed to
  `fix/nr-map-zoom-performance`, without merging `main`. Shared filters cover
  Home, province, district and subdistrict views; source counts are 20 irrigated,
  97 rain-fed and 172 unknown. Unknown irrigation is not missing forecast data.
- Migration `20260906010000` was applied after a dry run containing only that
  additive migration. History matches, the existing saved record defaults to
  `all`, and owner RLS remains enabled. No forecast import/publication or Auth,
  environment, policy or prediction changes were made.
- Quality Gate `33972914037` passed: 136 unit tests, 10 isolated database
  checks, 74 built browser tests (10 conditional skips), four database UI tests,
  both protected builds, exposure/bundle checks and no generated-data drift.
  The first run found an outdated three-dropdown assertion; the test-only
  follow-up checks four dropdowns and the new default. Its focused desktop and
  mobile regression also passed against the matching static-provider build.
- Deployment `dpl_Eo1sitfh7j4nBT6AJvagFg1VJn9j`
  (`https://korattanphai-g1471zzi1-purichwc-1517s-projects.vercel.app`) was
  built from the clean runtime commit with Production configuration. The
  follow-up changes only `e2e/app.spec.ts`; runtime, build configuration, smoke
  harness and source archive are identical. Candidate smoke passed and the
  same artifact was promoted without rebuilding. The production alias confirms
  this Ready deployment, `/assets/index-0e9ee1ef70.js` and backend `supabase`.
- Real-account candidate and production smoke passed five base routes plus all
  three irrigation groups and empty/reset behavior at 1440x960 and 390x844, including
  both exact source RPC projections, map codes/counts, login/logout, existing
  saved-filter reads, API/assets/headers and no overflow/static fallback.
  Evidence: `smoke-results/irrigation-candidate/report.json` and
  `smoke-results/irrigation-production/report.json`, both with zero failures.
  Desktop/mobile production screenshots were inspected with no observed
  toolbar, map-control or page overflow. An authenticated explicit
  `select('irrigation_criterion')` from PostgREST returned HTTP 200 with the
  existing record set to `all`, confirming the refreshed API schema.
- Read-only archive verification at 14:39 UTC confirms 220,218 unchanged cells,
  the pinned published version, both exact projections, anonymous access denied
  and digest `9352f69f7e86d1e8c549b03bc0b2e96ad1a46c7f3ef1ffa3bd09afd79175d01b`.
  Evidence: `smoke-results/database-integrity/report.json`.
- Recovery: promote `dpl_ALcUSdWNLxzaUKFp8ULLAR1mRA9L` and rerun smoke. Leave
  the additive column and personal records intact; old clients use `all`.
  No live personal-record writes, physical Safari or load/SLO tests are part
  of this release. See `IRRIGATION_FILTER.md` for the source and UI contracts.

Site-wide semantic UX production release (2026-09-05):

- Runtime `7d3bbfb2cd3f033287741b9b453c2b4f82b438da` is pushed to
  `fix/nr-map-zoom-performance`, without merging `main`. F01-F10 below are live.
- Exact-commit Quality Gate passed in 7m18s: 126 unit tests across 14 source
  files, 10 isolated database checks, 68 built browser tests (10 conditional
  skips), four separate database UI tests, both protected builds, exposure and
  bundle budgets, and unchanged generated data. CI:
  `https://github.com/purichw/korattanphai/actions/runs/33970845966`.
  The earlier local count of 228 also included 102 old tests from the ignored
  `tmp-snapshots/release-ui-cleanup-source` checkout; 126 is the release suite.
- Deployment `dpl_ALcUSdWNLxzaUKFp8ULLAR1mRA9L`
  (`https://korattanphai-10nrwwd3u-purichwc-1517s-projects.vercel.app`) was built
  from the clean runtime checkout using Production configuration. Candidate
  smoke passed before promotion; the same artifact was promoted without a
  rebuild. Inspection of `https://korattanphai.vercel.app` confirms this Ready
  deployment, `/assets/index-931658f70c.js` and backend `supabase`.
- Real-account candidate and production smoke passed all five routes at
  1440x960 and 390x844: Home, province, district, single high-risk tambon and
  all-null district. Both actual RPC projections exactly match canonical data;
  all 289 polygon risk classes match per route. Login/logout, saved-filter
  reads (including the prior test record), API, assets, cache/security headers,
  single full-width status, absent duplicate/demo panels, neutral unavailable
  graph and no horizontal overflow passed. Reports:
  `smoke-results/semantic-candidate/report.json` and
  `smoke-results/semantic-production/report.json` (zero failures).
- Fresh read-only API verification confirms one approved published dataset,
  source/normalized/canonical hashes, 220,218 unchanged cells and anonymous
  access denied. Ordered digest remains
  `9352f69f7e86d1e8c549b03bc0b2e96ad1a46c7f3ef1ffa3bd09afd79175d01b`.
  Evidence: `smoke-results/database-integrity/report.json` at 14:05 UTC.
  No database writes, imports, schema changes or external prediction sources.
- Production screenshots under `smoke-results/semantic-production/` were
  inspected. Additional in-app production checks confirmed one readiness
  status, no count gauge, map-mode roundtrip preserving T+4, and empty browser
  warning/error logs. Physical Safari and load/SLO testing were not run.
- Recovery: promote prior `dpl_yzioYF6cfvDjBN7dNkY4Rg3EyjHX` and rerun smoke;
  leave database data and configuration intact. No rollback was needed.
- Concurrent irrigation-filter work remains local and is not in this artifact.
  Only a documentation closeout commit follows the deployed runtime.

Site-wide semantic UX repair (2026-09-05, local/unreleased):

- Implemented F01-F10 from `SITEWIDE_SEMANTIC_AUDIT_2026-09-05.md`: unavailable
  forecasts no longer draw as zero-risk; coverage excludes null; chart copy
  describes fixed-target horizons and count-based references.
- Single-tambon shared variants show one forecast/evidence status, without
  population counts or self-links. Duplicate forecast details, empty historical
  analytics and unavailable area facts are hidden; designs remain in source.
- Readiness copy distinguishes supporting evidence from forecast quality;
  account menu hides demo personas/reset; Home area icons do not imply ranking.
- Canonical/generated archive data, Supabase schema/RLS and bookmarks contracts
  are unchanged. No push/deploy in this pass; production remains `ff01bd9`.
- Verification/remaining limitations are recorded in the audit closeout below
  its original findings. Local database-mode preview: `http://127.0.0.1:5176`.

Scoped archive and saved-workspace migration (2026-09-05):

- User authorized migration of only the approved Excel/normalized forecast
  archive and personal followed areas/saved filters, plus push/deploy and
  before/after data verification. No external data ingestion, ThaiWater,
  synthetic agriculture metrics, roles or notification workflows were added.
- Remote migrations `20260905110000` and `20260905124000` are applied, with
  matching migration history. The latter preserves publication/immutability
  guards while supporting the archive's explicit target-month convention;
  origin-based datasets retain their original six-horizon guard. Workbook time
  role remains unconfirmed, not retroactively asserted to be authoritative.
- Published version `drought-rev02-9b299cefc704` contains 220,218 source cells,
  762 runs, 127 target months and 289 locations. Counts are unchanged: 44,474
  no-risk, 27,670 moderate, 22,830 high and 125,244 explicit null/out-of-scope.
  Source workbook, normalized workbook, canonical JSON and generated projection
  hashes match the pinned inputs. Ordered remote prediction SHA-256:
  `9352f69f7e86d1e8c549b03bc0b2e96ad1a46c7f3ef1ffa3bd09afd79175d01b`.
  Import/publication evidence:
  `tmp-snapshots/archive-migration-eH6Tjy/verification.json`.
- Real authenticated API verification deep-compares both complete T+1 and
  T+1-T+6 RPC projections with source, confirms exactly one approved published
  dataset and denies anonymous reads. Archive tables deny browser writes;
  personal rows use owner-only RLS. Read-only real role/claim checks verified
  owner reads and cross-owner isolation. Evidence:
  `smoke-results/database-integrity/report.json`.
- Shared desktop/mobile bookmarks save area, target, horizon, dataset and map
  risk; restore works on the same pathname. Two smoke-account records remain:
  followed area Ban Kao (`300806`) and filter
  `ทดสอบ migration บ้านเก่า T+4`. They are personal records, not forecast data.
- Initial full CI rejected a URL-keyed workspace remount that closed the mobile
  filter sheet on keyboard selection. Runtime `ff01bd9f45f0c6e558620d904cd7e6dba853eba7`
  limits remounting to explicit saved-item restoration; the existing failing
  E2E test is unchanged and passed four focused desktop/mobile repetitions.
  Unit tests: 217 passed. Isolated PostgreSQL contract tests: 10 passed.
  Database-mode UI tests: four passed. Both static/database protected builds,
  exposure scans, bundle budgets and unchanged generated data passed locally.
- Runtime is pushed to `fix/nr-map-zoom-performance`, without merging `main`.
  Final full CI passed in 7m24s: unit/database tests, both UI suites, protected
  static/database builds, exposure/bundle checks and generated-data drift.
  Run: `https://github.com/purichw/korattanphai/actions/runs/33966743592`.
  Candidate `dpl_yzioYF6cfvDjBN7dNkY4Rg3EyjHX`
  (`https://korattanphai-lo1hs1kpa-purichwc-1517s-projects.vercel.app`) uses actual
  Production configuration and `VITE_DATA_BACKEND=supabase`. New database builds
  exclude both raw forecast assets and never fall back to static predictions.
- Candidate real-account smoke passed all four routes at 1440x960 and 390x844,
  with complete actual RPC/source comparisons and all 289 rendered map risk
  classes checked per route, saved-filter reads across fresh logins, no static
  fallback, login/logout, assets/API/security headers and no horizontal overflow.
  Evidence: `smoke-results/database-candidate-final/report.json`; screenshots
  were inspected. Hosted mobile keyboard selection keeps the filter sheet open;
  restoring the saved filter applies Dec-2025/T+4/high-risk correctly.
- After CI and candidate smoke passed, the candidate was promoted without
  rebuilding. Vercel inspection confirms `https://korattanphai.vercel.app`
  serves `dpl_yzioYF6cfvDjBN7dNkY4Rg3EyjHX`; `/data-backend.json` reports
  `supabase`. Production smoke then passed the same four routes at both sizes,
  actual full/T+1 RPC equality, all map risk classes, saved-record reads,
  login/logout, assets/API/cache/security headers and no browser errors or
  horizontal overflow. Evidence: `smoke-results/database-production/report.json`
  (zero failures), with inspected desktop/mobile screenshots. Production is
  complete; only the following documentation commit is newer than the artifact.
- Recovery: promote prior static-provider deployment
  `dpl_4SnrKbuepdKwJw7ZEZkAuzSUwgL3`
  (`https://korattanphai-qox5qsvrz-purichwc-1517s-projects.vercel.app`) and rerun
  smoke. Leave additive schema, immutable archive and personal records intact.
  No rollback performed. Older public archive asset URLs are not revoked.
  Real Safari, load/latency SLOs and unrelated operational-domain migrations
  are outside this release.

Combined UI cleanup production release (2026-09-05):

- User authorized push/deploy of completed work from both tasks, with care not
  to mix in the active Supabase migration. The migration owner confirmed no
  remote database mutations or runtime data-provider changes at this checkpoint.
  Migration files and subsequent runtime wiring remain local and outside this
  release. Forecast data still loads the static canonical archive; existing
  Supabase Auth is unchanged. No SQL/imports or remote settings were changed
  by this release.
- Includes district back navigation to `/drought` with target/T+ preserved,
  removal of the subdistrict-count chart only at subdistrict level, removal of
  source/limitations footer disclosures across all four page types, and the
  other task's accepted removal of synthetic Korat agriculture values while
  retaining their component design behind a REAL-only data gate.
- Local verification: 102 unit tests, normal/protected build, exposure and
  bundle-budget checks passed. Canonical archive and generated projections have
  no diff. The full built E2E run passed 64 tests with 6 existing skips; two
  drilldown cases still expected the removed subdistrict chart text. Their
  assertions now verify out-of-scope versus no-risk KPIs, and both desktop and
  mobile passed the focused rerun without runtime changes.
- Runtime commit: `089c0abca4b4e84d07e3a8392f9718346d9d4921`, pushed to
  `fix/nr-map-zoom-performance`; no merge into `main`. The full CI run for this
  exact commit passed 102 unit tests, protected build, exposure/bundle checks,
  generated-data drift and all 66 active E2E cases (6 existing skips):
  `https://github.com/purichw/korattanphai/actions/runs/33963294020`.
- Built from the clean detached checkout
  `tmp-snapshots/release-ui-cleanup-source`, with actual Vercel Production
  configuration and `--prod --skip-domain`. Candidate
  `dpl_4SnrKbuepdKwJw7ZEZkAuzSUwgL3`
  (`https://korattanphai-qox5qsvrz-purichwc-1517s-projects.vercel.app`) passed
  login-page, API, geometry and security-header checks before promotion.
  Vercel inspection confirms `https://korattanphai.vercel.app` now serves this
  Ready deployment; the browser loads `/assets/index-5c5e263482.js`.
- Production verification used an existing real authenticated Chrome session:
  home, province drought, two districts and a subdistrict load 289 polygons;
  source/limitations panels and synthetic agriculture numbers are absent.
  District back returns to `/drought`, subdistrict back returns to its district,
  and target `2025-12` / T+4 survive both actions. The subdistrict chart is
  absent and its map spans the full 1188px body; province/district charts remain.
  At the observed 1440x694 viewport, no horizontal overflow or broken visible
  images were found; browser warning/error logs were empty. Screenshots were
  inspected in the release task.
- Hosted routes, hashed JS/CSS, both forecast JSON assets, GeoJSON and API
  returned HTTP 200 with expected content types and cache policies; CSP and
  nosniff passed. Fresh credential login/logout and authenticated candidate
  smoke were not rerun: credentials were unavailable and Auth is unchanged.
  The browser viewport override did not take effect, so hosted mobile is not
  claimed; responsive coverage is the exact-commit desktop/mobile CI suite.
  Real Safari and Supabase database authorization checks are outside this UI
  release.
- Local evidence: `tmp-snapshots/release-ui-cleanup-build`,
  `tmp-snapshots/release-ui-cleanup-e2e`, and
  `tmp-snapshots/release-ui-cleanup-drilldown`.
- Recovery deployment captured before release: `dpl_BBDCsEEYmYdLAGnZRbBk2mEYsrS9`
  (`https://korattanphai-9anrsjid7-purichwc-1517s-projects.vercel.app`).
  No rollback performed. Keep the isolated checkout pinned; the primary working
  tree now contains the other task's in-progress Supabase provider/bookmark
  implementation. Do not deploy that working tree or change Production data
  flags until the separate migration approval and release gate are complete.

Combined Supabase Auth and UI production release (2026-09-05):

- Runtime commit: `15275fd2c0393fa8e50b933aafa0da1da44265be`, pushed to
  `fix/nr-map-zoom-performance`. Production was promoted to
  `dpl_BBDCsEEYmYdLAGnZRbBk2mEYsrS9` and verified through
  `https://korattanphai.vercel.app`; no merge into `main` was performed.
- Full CI for this runtime passed: 96 unit tests, protected build, exposure,
  bundle budgets, generated-data drift and 66 E2E tests with 6 existing skips.
  Run: `https://github.com/purichw/korattanphai/actions/runs/33957336832`.
- Real-account smoke passed on the protected candidate and then the public
  production alias: login/logout, refresh/navigation, four routes at desktop
  1440x960 and mobile 390x844, 289 polygons, forecast counts/context, API,
  asset/cache/security headers, visible images and no horizontal overflow.
  Evidence: `smoke-results/combined-auth-ui-candidate` and
  `smoke-results/combined-auth-ui-production`; both reports have zero failures.
- Vercel's Production URL variable incorrectly held the Supabase dashboard
  URL. Corrected only `VITE_SUPABASE_URL` to the project's HTTPS API origin;
  the existing publishable key was valid and unchanged. The first candidate
  build rejected the invalid URL before publishing; the retry passed.
- The user disabled self-signup. Read-only Auth settings verification returned
  `disable_signup: true` and email provider enabled. No tables, RLS, data,
  accounts or passwords were modified by the release.
- Protected-candidate smoke now accepts an authorized, host-scoped Vercel
  session in memory, with input validation, redirect rejection and redaction.
  It does not bypass Supabase login or persist either session/credentials.
  The follow-up changes only this harness and release documentation, not the
  runtime artifact already promoted. Two negative input-guard checks passed.
- Real Safari, SMTP/recovery and database/RLS authorization audits are outside
  this release. GitHub smoke-account secrets remain unconfigured; the real
  deployment smoke was run locally with session-only credentials.

Pre-release evidence and scope:

- The user now authorizes commit, push and production deployment of both
  tasks on `fix/nr-map-zoom-performance`. No merge into `main` or database
  mutation is implied. This supersedes the earlier local-only authorization.
- Includes the shared month-only options, unclipped map dropdowns, borderless
  map controls, compact fullscreen filters, centered horizon tabs, chart label
  spacing, formal stat descriptions and accepted duplicate-panel removal.
- Unit tests: 96 passed. Protected build, exposure scan, bundle budgets and
  generated-data drift check passed; production dependency audit found zero
  vulnerabilities. Build: `tmp-snapshots/release-combined-auth-ui`.
- Combined protected-build E2E: 65 passed, 6 existing skips, one mobile
  drilldown flow exceeded its 60-second test budget. The identical test/build
  passed two isolated runs (48.1s and 25.8s), without timeout or code changes.
  Evidence: `tmp-snapshots/release-combined-e2e` and
  `tmp-snapshots/release-drilldown-recheck`. This local run was not clean;
  the later complete CI run above passed all 66 active scenarios.
- Hosted real-account verification remains separate from local mock evidence.
- Vercel inspection found both Supabase variables in Production only, not
  Preview. Use `vercel --prod --skip-domain --yes` to prepare a candidate with
  actual configuration, verify it, then promote without rebuilding fixtures.
- Pre-release recovery: `dpl_DURL6bv3X7RmiPPcmCTPwVVSM127`, serving
  `https://korattanphai.vercel.app` before this release. No rollback performed.

Supabase Auth implementation details:

- Email/password login now uses the Supabase SDK, not demo usernames. Shared
  client configuration, session loading/refresh, stale-result guards, safe
  logout errors and internal-only return paths are covered by local tests.
- Account identity is the Supabase name/email; persona is display context only.
- Only the retired demo-login key is cleared. Static data remains public and
  no SQL, RLS or forecast provider is changed.
- Exact HTTPS Supabase origin added to CSP. Missing config denies entry;
  privileged keys fail the build. Production exposure checks remain active.
- Browser fixtures mock Supabase only on localhost. Real credentials are now
  required for deployment smoke; GitHub secrets are not set by this change.
- Local mocked auth checks do not verify the user's account, RLS or providers.
  `docs/AUTH_SETUP.md` contains the Preview checklist and SMTP recovery caveat.

Compact dashboard release checkpoint (2026-09-05):

- User authorized commit, push and production deployment of the Home v4 and
  shared compact drought/district/subdistrict work described below. Publish
  branch: `fix/nr-map-zoom-performance`; no merge into `main` is implied.
- Final release build: `tmp-snapshots/release-compact-20260905-build`.
  TypeScript, protected assets, exposure and bundle-budget checks passed.
  Its index and JS/CSS/JSON assets are byte-identical to the Home v4 build
  already inspected across desktop, tablet and mobile. Canonical source data,
  generated archive data and GeoJSON have no changes in this release.
- Final full protected-build E2E:56 passed,6 configured skips,0 failures in1.5m.
  Output: `tmp-snapshots/release-compact-20260905-e2e`. This supersedes the
  earlier combined-run evidence below. Unit/data evidence:63 passed on the
  same source/dependencies. Existing large-chunk warning remains non-fatal.
- Production target: `https://korattanphai.vercel.app`. After publication, run
  the read-only smoke harness with output at
  `smoke-results/release-compact-20260905`; local build results alone are not
  evidence that the production alias has been updated.
- Pre-release production recovery deployment: `dpl_Ddjv9NnwyRsXoUFFhuAHvDAfmVrs`
  (`https://korattanphai-o2ajhjjmi-purichwc-1517s-projects.vercel.app`, Ready
  before this release). Previous source: `2117253ce3a49c8bb2805c93f83d89190c0db1f6`.
  Recovery would promote that deployment and rerun production smoke; no
  rollback is requested or performed. Earlier parked water/history removals
  remain intentional and unchanged.
- Real Safari and new network benchmarks are outside this release pass.

Home Overview v4 (2026-09-05, local; not pushed/deployed):

- `/` now follows the supplied v4 interaction documents and three image
  references: compact filters, a passive situation strip, aligned map/risk panel,
  three high-risk area links, agriculture/readiness disclosures and archive link.
  Mobile shows counts before the map, then area links and expandable details.
- Reuses `OperationalFilters`/`AppSelect`, `MetricGrid`/`MetricCard`, the existing
  agriculture/readiness panels and the shared SVG map. New `DashboardDetailPanel`
  separates its explicit disclosure button from passive preview statistics.
  Opt-in Home variants leave drought/district/subdistrict defaults intact.
- Short stats/dropdown values remain centered; long descriptions remain left
  aligned. All high-risk areas are reachable in-place, with context-preserving
  drilldown. Readiness switches the same map instance and has a return action.
- Real T+1 archive target/issue dates, risk semantics, provenance and no-data
  behavior are preserved. No live timestamp, district rai, model confidence or
  ThaiWater data was invented/restored. Agriculture has separate province-wide
  scope and provenance. The Home loader still avoids the full forecast archive.
- Unit/data tests:63 passed. Full protected-build E2E:53 passed,3 failed,6 skips;
  obsolete filter assertions and a test hydration race were corrected. Final
  focused protected-build rerun:25 passed,1 skip. All56 active scenarios passed
  across the full run and focused rerun, not one final full-suite execution.
- Final build: `tmp-snapshots/home-v4-verified-build`. TypeScript, exposure,
  bundle/reference checks and canonical archive identity passed. Startup107,787
  gzip bytes; the existing large-chunk warning remains.
- Screenshots/metrics: `tmp-snapshots/home-v4-accepted-3eatug`. Desktop, reference
  tablet, both tablet orientations and mobile have no horizontal overflow, with
  fonts/logo loaded and no page errors or HTTP4xx/5xx responses. Fullscreen and
  disclosure states were also checked. Desktop height1476 ->1002px; mobile
  height2399 ->1799px, through disclosure rather than information removal.
- See `HOME_OVERVIEW_PARITY.md` for reference identities, measured landmarks,
  visual exceptions, comparison provenance and exact verification scope. Real
  Safari, production and new network benchmarks were intentionally not run.

Compact drought operational workspace (2026-09-05, local; not pushed/deployed):

- `/drought`, district and subdistrict routes share one compact forecast
  composition, header, real forecast filters and expandable operational details.
  The retired historical-month filter is no longer the primary page filter.
- Short stat labels/values and dropdown values center. Main statistics reuse
  `MetricGrid`/`MetricCard`; all dropdowns reuse `AppSelect`. Mobile shows every
  risk count without horizontal scrolling, then coverage, chart and map.
- Desktop map/chart align, with full-width statistics below. Sources, limitations,
  agriculture, historical evidence and readiness remain accessible. Empty
  historical data is unavailable, not a reassuring zero-count state.
- Area navigation now carries target/horizon. Readiness switches the existing
  map instance and provides a return action. Compact camera fitting respects the
  global maximum zoom and keeps the selected subdistrict inside the viewport.
- Canonical forecast/geodata bytes and root T+1 overview behavior are unchanged.
  No ThaiWater or invented low-risk data was restored. Reference decisions and
  visual exceptions: `DROUGHT_WORKSPACE_PARITY.md`.
- Verification: 60 unit/data tests passed. The full protected-build E2E run
  passed 48 scenarios, failed one compact-map popup containment scenario and
  retained five existing skips. After fixing popup bounds, the final targeted
  run passed all 10 scenarios (popup actions, shared compact routes and dropdown
  wheel isolation). All 49 active scenarios therefore passed across the full
  run and focused rerun, not in one final full-suite run.
- Final protected build passed TypeScript, exposure, bundle/reference checks and
  canonical archive byte identity. Output: `tmp-snapshots/drought-parity-closeout-build`.
  Startup is 107,905 gzip bytes; the existing large-chunk warning remains.
- Current screenshots and `metrics.json`:
  `tmp-snapshots/drought-parity-accepted-wLeXFO`. All nine captures loaded the
  font, had no horizontal page overflow, and measured centered KPI labels/values.
  Capture recorded no page errors or HTTP 4xx/5xx responses. Fullscreen entered
  and exited successfully with a visible 1,002px-high SVG.
- At 1586x992 the province page is 1,022px tall (previously 1,684px); at 390x844
  it is 2,096px (previously 2,885px). District/subdistrict mobile heights fell
  from 6,438/4,846px to 2,077/2,137px through disclosure, not data removal.
- Chromium desktop/mobile and both tablet orientations were checked. Real
  Safari, production and a new network benchmark were intentionally skipped.
  Earlier deployment checkpoints below do not mean this local UI was deployed.

Combined release checkpoint (2026-09-05):

- The user authorized committing, pushing and deploying all work from both
  concurrent Korat tasks on `fix/nr-map-zoom-performance`.
- Province overview now displays the latest archived T+1 forecast, with month
  and district filters, scoped counts, high-risk area links and context-preserving
  drilldown. The shared forecast workspace remains available at province,
  district and subdistrict levels. This is archived prediction, not live data.
- The lightweight overview asset is generated from the unchanged canonical
  archive; the full T+1-T+6 archive loads only on detail routes. The release also
  includes the reliability, code-splitting, shared-component and CI work below.
- Release checks: 57 unit/data tests passed; protected build, exposure and
  bundle checks passed. All 39 active desktop/mobile E2E scenarios passed across
  the full run and focused reruns; five existing configured skips remain.
- One map test was corrected after trace evidence showed that deselection
  succeeded but camera movement opened a different hover preview under a
  stationary pointer. The test now checks selection removal, then moves the
  pointer outside the map before checking preview dismissal. It passed twice
  per viewport; product behavior was not changed for this correction.
- Verification artifact: `tmp-snapshots/release-combined-20260905`. Screenshots,
  traces and temporary builds are ignored, not release source files.
- Pre-release recovery deployment: `dpl_4uc1a42qX3rgxBSeJ2xAZm2TdBoi`, associated
  with the previously published work through `440b707`. Production publication
  and post-deploy smoke follow this checkpoint; these local checks alone do not
  prove deployment. Run `npm run smoke` against the published alias for evidence.

Non-functional follow-up (2026-09-05, local work; not deployed by this task):

- Added root/content error boundaries, storage-unavailable notices, in-document
  fallback storage and validation of persisted runtime records. Initial provider
  mount no longer rewrites a saved snapshot; toasts are not saved.
- Login is now a lightweight entry with a lazy `AuthenticatedApp` chunk.
  Login redirects retain query/hash, and ordinary internal content links retain
  the current document so blocked storage does not end the demo session.
- Extracted the large Nakhon workspace into `components/nakhon-ratchasima/`:
  archive calculations, map, forecast controls/workspace, shared research panels,
  and province/district/subdistrict views. The root is now route composition.
- Added startup and total-JS budgets plus static chunk-reference validation.
  `BUILD_OUT_DIR` supports isolated verification artifacts during concurrent work.
- Added GitHub quality/deployment-smoke workflows and a read-only smoke harness.
  Runbook: `PRODUCTION_SMOKE.md`. Workflows are not active until pushed; repository
  protections and Vercel deployment blocking are separate configuration.
- The concurrent T+1 overview changes were retained. Regression expectations for
  its primary map, area selection and context-carrying drilldown were updated;
  forecast counts and canonical archive bytes remain independently checked.
- Verification: 57 unit/data tests passed. All 37 active desktop/mobile E2E
  scenarios passed across the full run and targeted reruns after fixes; the five
  pre-existing skips remain. SVG click tests now wait for the camera to settle,
  and wheel zoom targets a hit-tested background instead of a hover preview.
- Protected build, exposure checks and bundle/reference checks passed in
  `tmp-snapshots/nfr-final2-20260905`. Read-only smoke also passed against the
  existing production deployment; that does not deploy these local changes.

Non-functional archive loading pass (2026-09-05, local work after `440b707`):

- Removed the full forecast archive from the synchronous catalog/domain import
  chain. `src/data/forecastArchive.ts` now fetches a content-hashed JSON asset
  on drought/district/subdistrict routes; login and overview do not fetch it.
- The overview summary is generated from the canonical archive before dev/build.
  Archive source bytes, counts, risk values, and target/T+ semantics are unchanged.
- Added loading/failure/retry handling that preserves the deep-link selection,
  a shared archive request/cache, and local geometry prefetch/cache to load map
  assets alongside the archive and reuse parsed geometry across navigation.
- Profiling caught startup work added by the obfuscator's base64 decoding and
  string-array rotation. Both options are now disabled; identifier obfuscation,
  string tables, source-map exclusion, and blocked-literal checks remain active.
- `npm run check:bundle` guards JS size and verifies emitted archive bytes.
  `npm run test:e2e:built` tests the current `dist`; `npm run measure:load -- label`
  records repeatable local measurements. See `NON_FUNCTIONAL_REQUIREMENTS.md`.
- No production deployment is part of this pass.
- Final local checks: 43 unit/data tests passed; protected build, exposure and
  bundle checks passed; built desktop/mobile E2E passed 25 tests with 5 existing
  configured skips (legacy national-map checks and mobile frame-count check).
  The suite covers unchanged forecast counts, deep links, month/horizon controls,
  drill-down, keyboard/dropdown wheel isolation, map previews/zoom, retry,
  navigation during loading, geometry reuse and optional-context failures.

Recent completed work before this docs pass:

- Thai localization expanded across the app.
- Google Sans font stack added.
- Risk-event and crop text overflow fixed on desktop and mobile.
- Playwright smoke updated for Thai-first workflow.
- Production deploy completed and smoked.

Current incremental source/layer pass:

- Added source registry and map layer catalogue fixtures.
- Added data class, layer availability, and derived-risk fusion semantics.
- Replaced the visible EN language surface with Thai-only UI copy.
- Added layer selector/provenance/no-data handling to the map.
- Updated risk-event, crop, map, and data/model surfaces for clearer
  source-vs-derived wording.
- README, PROJECT_MAP, and dedicated docs updated for the new contract.

Current Nakhon Ratchasima research/data patch:

- Added `src/data/canonical/nakhon_ratchasima/` fixtures from the deep research
  bundle as additive local data.
- Added `public/geodata/nakhon-ratchasima-subdistricts.geojson` with 289
  subdistrict features for province code `30`.
- Preserved Nakhon Ratchasima as the existing canonical province `TH-P29`; no
  second province object was created.
- Naming correction: province-level UI/docs must say Nakhon Ratchasima
  province. Do not use local nicknames or district/local names as synonyms for
  the province.
- Added root-level Nakhon Ratchasima client routes: `/`, `/drought`,
  `/{district-slug}`, and `/{district-slug}/{subdistrict-slug}`. Legacy
  `/nakhon-ratchasima/...` aliases remain accepted for old links.
- Added `NakhonRatchasimaWorkspace` for province, district, and subdistrict
  drill-down with source freshness, inherited context, local evidence, map layer
  selection, and explicit no-data states.
- Added regression coverage for 32 districts, 289 subdistricts, admin-code
  joins, GISTDA GeoJSON coverage, forecast/no-data semantics, Soeng Sang
  investigation limits, and route drill-down.

Current Nakhon Ratchasima rainfall patch:

- Added rainfall source audit and fixtures:
  `rainfall_source_audit.json`, `rainfall_stations.json`,
  `rainfall_observations_24h.json`, `rainfall_monthly_history.json`, and
  `subdistrict_rainfall_coverage.json`.
- Added 49 REAL DWR EWS station points and a 289-subdistrict coverage matrix:
  29 direct-station subdistricts, 260 nearest-station representative records,
  and 0 no-source records in the current matrix.
- Kept `ปริมาณฝนและสถานี` in the raw Nakhon Ratchasima layer catalogue, but the
  Korat Tan Phai product UI now hides water, flood, reservoir, weather, and
  rainfall layers until they are needed for a confirmed prediction workflow.
- Kept `rainfall_observations_24h.json` empty by design. Do not copy unjoined
  province/station values into every subdistrict or silently convert them into
  agricultural risk.
- Preserved seven historical DWR rainfall-warning samples as context only; they
  are not current rainfall readings.
- Updated docs and tests to lock the proxy/no-data contract.

Current province workspace/navigation patch:

- National map detail actions now open canonical province workspace routes.
- `/nakhon-ratchasima` remains the seeded Nakhon Ratchasima province workspace;
  its district/subdistrict child routes are still owned by
  `NakhonRatchasimaWorkspace`.
- Other canonical provinces open `/{province-slug}` placeholder dashboards via
  `ProvinceWorkspacePlaceholder`.
- Placeholder dashboards include situation, agriculture, and data-readiness
  containers, but they must not display missing local evidence as normal risk or
  a completed data-readiness feature.

Current Nakhon Ratchasima SVG map zoom performance patch:

- Confirmed the production map renders 590 paths under
  `g.nr-map-transform-layer`; button and wheel zoom previously updated React
  state on every animation frame, forcing repeated reconciliation of the large
  SVG layer while the transform was moving.
- Added an imperative transient transform path for zoom, wheel, drag, and pinch:
  the visible SVG matrix is written directly during interaction, then React
  state is committed once after the visual transform settles. The deferred
  state commit is cancelable so rapid follow-up input does not wait behind an
  older reconciliation pass.
- Added a separate intended button-zoom target so rapid repeated clicks stack
  the configured zoom step, clamp to the configured bounds, and do not animate
  toward stale partial transforms. Zoom in followed immediately by zoom out now
  returns to the prior intended transform.
- Memoized local feature path strings for the heavy map layers so the final
  React commit no longer recomputes every SVG path string from GeoJSON.
- Preserved GeoJSON, feature counts, risk/readiness semantics, colors, labels,
  route focus, reset/current-area behavior, pan clamping, wheel containment,
  drag/pinch, fullscreen, preview cards, Thai accessible labels, and responsive
  layout.
- Before measurement against production: one button zoom caused 4 React commits
  and the sampled transform tail lasted roughly 354-407 ms; wheel/reset cases
  showed tails around 1.3-1.5 s, and three rapid zoom-in clicks only advanced
  one zoom step.
- After measurement against a local production build (`npm run preview`):
  1440, 1024, 768, 430, and 390 px viewports all kept 590 transform-layer
  paths, showed button first response in 18-40 ms, button visual settlement in
  136-148 ms, rapid three-click zoom reached the full intended target, wheel
  zoom settled in roughly 155-174 ms where tested, reduced-motion zoom settled
  in roughly 11 ms, and no JavaScript errors or horizontal overflow were
  observed.
- Verification for this patch: `git diff --check`, `npm test`,
  `npm run build`, and `npm run test:e2e:managed`.

Current Nakhon Ratchasima local boundary patch:

- Confirmed a separate geometry issue from the zoom-performance issue: the 289
  colored local polygons came from
  `public/geodata/nakhon-ratchasima-subdistricts.geojson`, but the visible white
  province outline came from the separate ADM1 dataset. The two sources do not
  match exactly, so the outline visibly separated from the colored union when
  zoomed.
- Added `scripts/generate-nr-boundary.mjs` and `npm run generate:nr-boundary`
  to deterministically dissolve the 289 local subdistrict geometries into
  `public/geodata/nakhon-ratchasima-boundary.geojson`. The generated artifact
  records source metadata, all 289 Admin codes, source feature count, and bbox.
- Updated `NakhonRatchasimaWorkspace` so the local map fetches the generated
  boundary artifact for the visible Nakhon Ratchasima province outline.
  `thailand-adm1.geojson` remains in use only for national/neighboring-province
  context and labels.
- Removed the redundant province halo/base casing paths, removed the large
  province drop shadow, and now render one clipped white boundary after the
  colored subdistrict polygons. The stroke remains non-scaling, but the clip
  keeps the visible weight inside the dissolved local boundary.
- Audited district/subdistrict focus casing and reduced the focused-area white
  casing from the previous heavy treatment to a lighter non-scaling outline
  while preserving selection and preview halos.
- Added deterministic artifact validation in `tests/domain.test.ts` and browser
  contract coverage in `e2e/app.spec.ts` for artifact loading, removed casing
  layer, clipped province boundary, and focus-casing stroke weight.

Current shared UI and component-memory patch:

- Added `docs/SHARED_COMPONENTS.md` as the living inventory for exported shared
  components and local Nakhon workspace primitives.
- Created local Codex skills:
  `$korat-tan-phai-shared-components` for component reuse and
  `$korat-tan-phai-new-chat` for up-to-date fresh-chat onboarding.
- Expanded `AppSelect` with explicit `align` support and kept product dropdown
  trigger text centered by default across province, district, subdistrict, and
  map filter surfaces.
- Expanded `MetricCard`/`MetricGrid` contracts and routed stat-only agriculture
  and readiness cards through shared centered stat primitives.
- Added `MapPreviewFooter` and reused it from both `RiskMap` and the local
  Nakhon map so preview actions and fallback notes share one implementation.
- Fixed province-map transient selection so a selected feature can be cleared
  without refreshing, while route-selected subdistricts remain locked only on
  the matching route; clearing also suppresses immediate hover preview repaint
  while the map animates back.
- Raised local map preview card stacking and overflow behavior so district and
  subdistrict preview cards are not hidden behind following agriculture or
  readiness sections.
- Centered the shared preview fallback note, including the "insufficient data to
  open detail" state.

Current rev02 drought forecast archive patch:

- Added `src/data/canonical/nakhon_ratchasima/drought_forecast_archive_rev02.json`
  from `Drought_T1-6_rev02_Normalized_ArchiveReady(1).xlsx` using
  `scripts/build-nr-drought-forecast-archive.py`.
- The archive maps 289 Source_IDs to all 289 canonical subdistricts, spans 127
  target months from `2015-06` through `2025-12`, keeps horizons T+1 through
  T+6 as separate forecast vintages, and contains 220,218 canonical vintages.
- Product archive semantics: `Source_YearMonth` is the target month,
  `issueMonth = targetMonth - horizon`, and record identity is
  `subdistrictCode + targetMonth + horizon`.
- Risk values remain source semantics: `0` no forecast risk, `1` moderate
  forecast risk, `2` high forecast risk, and blank workbook cells are
  out-of-scope, not no-risk and not join failures.
- The existing local historical map panel data in
  `normalized_research_monthly_panel.json` and
  `normalized_research_panel_summary.json` remains cleared for the dataset
  refresh. Do not restore the old `2025-12` historical map periods unless a new
  source-backed refresh explicitly asks for it.
- Province, district, and subdistrict drought pages now share the same archive
  module family: `DroughtForecastArchivePanel`,
  `DroughtForecastArchiveHorizonSelector`,
  `DroughtForecastArchiveSummaryMetrics`, `DroughtForecastArchiveMapFilters`,
  and `NakhonRatchasimaLocalMap`.
- Latest production deployment after this patch: commit
  `18d4e9dcb28da78a99343d2e2bd7226905fddce0` (`feat: add rev02 drought
  forecast archive`) deployed to `https://korattanphai.vercel.app`.
- Latest release checks passed: `git diff --check`, `npm test`, `npm run build`,
  `npm run test:e2e:managed`, `npm run build:protected`, Vercel production
  build/protect/exposure check, and production smoke for `/`, `/drought`,
  `/dan-khun-thot`, `/dan-khun-thot/t-300806`, the legacy route, an unseeded
  route, geodata endpoints, and `/api/risk-fusion?eventId=ARE-2026-0825-NE`.

## Open Risks

- The app is not operationally safe for real emergency alerting yet.
- Supabase real-account login/logout and closed self-signup are verified.
  User-reported tables/RLS remain unaudited. No database data provider,
  notification delivery or live data ingestion is implemented.
- Vite build has a chunk-size warning due bundled canonical JSON.
- Map fetch has a loading state but no explicit error state.
- No real delivery guarantee or acknowledgement receipt exists.
- SEO/noindex decision is not confirmed.
- Official data source licensing and attribution need audit before live data use.
- DWR or other approved station-specific live rainfall access still needs audit
  before importing current 24-hour rainfall readings.
- The rev02 drought forecast archive is static source-backed fixture data, not
  a live prediction service. Any future dataset replacement must preserve the
  target-month/T+ identity unless the data model is explicitly changed.

## Known Bugs / Limitations

- Browser localStorage can contain stale demo state until Reset Demo Data or the
  current key (`korat-tan-phai-demo-state-v1`) changes again.
- Editing Thai-localized advisory textarea values may store Thai text in runtime
  even though canonical fixture actions are English strings.
- Production copy still includes necessary codes/acronyms such as TMD, GISTDA,
  ARE, ADV, FARM, SMS, LINE.
- Local Codex skills live under `/Users/point/.codex/skills/` and are not part
  of the GitHub repository unless explicitly copied into project docs.
- This repo has no markdown lint command.

## Commands Run Recently

Known release commands from earlier production push/deploys:

```bash
git diff --check
npm run build
npm test
npm run test:e2e
git commit -m "Polish Thai responsive prototype UI"
git push origin main
vercel --prod --yes
```

Docs pass expected checks:

```bash
git status --short
git diff --check
npm run build
npm run build:protected
npm test
npm run test:e2e:managed
```

Latest local verification for the source/layer Thai-only patch:

```bash
git diff --check
npm run build
npm test
npx playwright test
```

Latest local verification for the Nakhon Ratchasima patch:

```bash
npm run build
npm test
npm run test:e2e
```

Result: build passed, 17 unit/data tests passed, and 10 Playwright e2e tests
passed across desktop and mobile.

Latest local verification for the Nakhon Ratchasima rainfall patch:

```bash
npm test
```

Result: 20 unit/data tests passed.

Latest verification for the rev02 drought forecast archive production deploy:

```bash
git diff --check
npm test
npm run build
npm run test:e2e:managed
npm run build:protected
```

Result: 34 unit/data tests passed; 15 managed Playwright checks passed and 5
were skipped by configured route scope; build and protected build passed. Vercel
production deployment `dpl_319gogrp1qzKLUApcjdGgQeuszLF` passed production
smoke with no console errors, failed requests, or horizontal overflow observed
on the checked pages.

Notes:

- `npm run test:e2e` initially failed inside the sandbox because Playwright could
  not bind the local Vite port (`listen EPERM 127.0.0.1:5173`), then
  `npx playwright test` passed when allowed to run local browser automation.
- Snapshot evidence was captured outside git under
  `/private/tmp/korattanphai-snapshots/`.
- Checked desktop 1440px and mobile 390px for Risk events, Crops, Map, and
  Data/Models; no horizontal document overflow was reported.

## Recommended Next Steps

1. Confirm whether the production prototype should be indexed or noindex.
2. Add a map fetch error state.
3. Add production smoke script for repeatable post-deploy checks.
4. Consider lazy-loading large canonical JSON.
5. Decide future backend boundaries before adding live alerts or real users.
6. Human-review public-safety copy before any operational launch.
7. Human-confirm whether GISTDA local geometry attribution/licensing wording is
   sufficient before operational/public-safety use.

## How Another Agent Should Continue Safely

- Start with `README.md`, then `PROJECT_MAP.md` when starting a fresh Codex
  task.
- Use `$korat-tan-phai-new-chat` for a fresh Codex chat and
  `$korat-tan-phai-shared-components` before changing shared UI primitives.
- Read the focused doc for the surface being changed.
- Check `git status --short` before editing.
- Do not use chat history as the source of truth when docs and code are present.
- Do not collapse Nakhon Ratchasima province into a local nickname in UI, docs,
  fixtures, prompts, or implementation notes.
- Do not commit, push, deploy, migrate, or touch production data unless the
  current user explicitly asks for it.
- Use `$release-gate` before any release action.
- Use `$snapshot` for visible UI changes.
