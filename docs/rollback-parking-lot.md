## 2026-10-03 — Approved legacy runtime/data cleanup (local)

- User reviewed the 52-path proposal and explicitly approved “ลบ”. The isolated
  worktree is `/Users/point/korattanphai/artifacts/legacy-cleanup-20261003`.
- Baseline: `ce9d98ba021f087675ce61c8645d30c233472bae`; source checkpoint:
  `/Users/point/korattanphai/artifacts/legacy-audit-20261003/before-cleanup.tar`.
  Its 613 tracked entries were captured before edits. The adjacent
  `deletion-manifest.json` records baseline blob identities.
- Removed 51 listed paths. Preserved/refactored `OperationalFilters.tsx` after
  proving the active Overview still consumes it; no fake month defaults remain.
- No commit/push/deploy, database write, migration or other checkout changes.
  Stored originals/history and the genuine rev03/geometry resources are intact.
- Restore only on an explicit request: extract selected checkpoint files into
  a separate review directory and reconcile their consumers against current
  code. Never extract the archive over the working checkout or restore old
  synthetic records into production. Preserve current auth, rev03, admin and
  map-label contracts. See `LEGACY_CLEANUP_20261003.md` for checks/exceptions.


## 2026-09-06 — Abandon Subdistrict UI Redesign

- Request: explicitly roll back all subdistrict UI redesign work.
- Status: intentionally abandoned by the user; no restoration pending.
- Baseline: `757143f20b3dc2f16360d1e606f6c8820f92613f`; its runtime matches
  verified production commit `8cfa2824f81b9bb886b7479ef9d36a0c6dbcdf41`.
- Checkpoint: `tmp-snapshots/rollback-subdistrict-ui-20260906/`, containing
  the scoped working/index patches, original files, manifest and parked new
  stylesheet/spec. Existing screenshots remain in the task snapshot directory.
- Scope: subdistrict grid/rail, new note, selector deduplication, style changes,
  keyboard additions, loading/navigation follow-ups and their tests/docs.
- Preserve: all concurrent rev03 data/importer/migration work, including its
  archive references and data-specific fixtures/expectations in shared tests. Published forward T+
  semantics and production risk colors/readiness visibility remain intact.
- Restore only on a new explicit request: selectively reapply checkpoint UI
  hunks, rewire the parked stylesheet, reconcile any newer data contracts and
  verify route layout/selection/loading. Do not apply the full patch over
  unrelated work or revert rev03 references.
- Verification: all eight runtime owner files match the verified production
  commit byte-for-byte. Desktop 1440 px and mobile 390 px checks passed: six
  forward T+ tabs, original page/map selectors, 289 map polygons, guidance
  disclosure, no page errors or horizontal overflow. Both snapshots reviewed;
  `git diff --check` passed. No production change; broader release tests skipped.

## 2026-09-05 - Remove Synthetic Korat Metrics, Preserve Components

- Request: delete the synthetic numbers and remove their UI, keeping the
  component design hidden for future source-backed data.
- Checkpoint: Git branch `checkpoint/nr-synthetic-metrics-removal-20260905`
  at `4139250f8a94f3be079d0d7ba170fac5ee1597f3`. The worktree was clean before
  this change; no untracked files or database state are involved.
- Status: intentionally hidden, accepted by the user; no restoration pending.
- Removed: 22 TH-P29 synthetic monthly records from
  `src/data/canonical/province_monthly_risk.json`, and their agriculture/rai/
  confidence metrics from Home and the province drought disclosure.
- Retained: `AgricultureImpactPanel`, `AgricultureVisibilityPanel`, shared
  MetricCard/MetricGrid design, their CSS, and the source-backed rendering path.
  Missing or non-REAL agriculture records now render nothing, not zero.
- Untouched: Excel rev02 canonical archive, generated T+1 projection, all
  forecast values, administrative geography, readiness evidence, and unrelated
  legacy records for other provinces.
- Restore only on an explicit future request with verified source-backed
  agriculture data and its reference period; do not restore synthetic records
  from the checkpoint into public UI. Verify source guard, component rendering,
  responsive layouts, and unchanged archive counts.
- Verification: 50 focused unit/data tests, TypeScript/Vite build, and 8
  desktop/mobile E2E scenarios passed (Home and all three drought scopes).
  Canonical archive and both generated projections/summaries match the
  checkpoint byte-for-byte. Screenshot checks found no horizontal overflow or
  page errors; readiness navigation and all four Home forecast counts remain
  intact. Evidence: `tmp-snapshots/no-synthetic-metrics/`.
  Unrelated concurrent navigation/chart edits were preserved. No push/deploy.

## 2026-09-05 15:31 +07:00 - Remove Duplicate Forecast Narrative

- Request: explicitly remove the large six-horizon narrative/timeline panel
  after reviewing its duplication of the chart and KPI strip.
- Checkpoint: `tmp-snapshots/rollback-checkpoints/remove-forecast-narrative-2026-09-05T08-31-48-948Z/`
  contains pre-edit owner files, working/staged diffs, status, and untracked
  inventory. No untracked files are involved in this removal.
- Status: intentional removal accepted by the user; no restoration pending.
- Removed: `DroughtForecastNarrativeDetail` and its shared live call on
  province, district, and subdistrict drought routes.
- Preserved: chart, KPI strip, map, target/T+ selection, archive context and
  source caveats under the existing details disclosure. Data and shared model
  helpers are unchanged; historical styling is not part of this cleanup.
- Restore only on an explicit new request: selectively restore the component
  and call from the checkpoint, reconcile the shared-component docs and route
  assertions, then verify disclosure behavior on all three scopes. Do not
  overwrite unrelated in-progress changes with the full checkpoint patch.
- Verification passed: 13 focused forecast unit tests and live local checks
  for all three route scopes (province/district desktop, subdistrict mobile).
  Chart/map/KPIs, T+ selection, archive context/caveats, and disclosure keyboard
  toggle remain working. Snapshot: `tmp-snapshots/forecast-narrative-removed-1440.png`.
  Full-site tests and deployment were not run for this scoped removal.

## 2026-09-04 23:08 +07:00 - Remove Retired Water-Provider Data From Web

- Request: remove all retired external water-provider data from the website,
  including bundled fixtures, source IDs, URLs, ingest tooling, public API
  payloads, and product documentation that could reintroduce that provider.
- Checkpoint:
  `/tmp/codex-rollback-checkpoints/korattanphai-remove-retired-water-provider-data-20260904-230833/`
- Checkpoint branch:
  `checkpoint/before-retired-water-provider-removal-20260904-230833`
- Release status: verified locally before the requested push/deploy.
- Removed from live app:
  - retired provider forecast fixture and province water snapshot fixture;
  - retired provider ingest script;
  - source-registry, source-matrix, rainfall audit, map-layer, API, and
    risk-fusion references to the retired provider;
  - public drought trend wiring that depended on the removed current-provider
    forecast fixture.
- Will keep in the app:
  - rev02 drought forecast archive as the public prediction source;
  - DWR EWS station/source coverage metadata;
  - TMD regional/monthly context metadata;
  - empty current rainfall observation schema until an approved live source and
    station/admin-code crosswalk exist.
- Restore checklist:
  - restore the removed fixture/import/script files from the checkpoint branch
    only if a future product decision explicitly reintroduces that provider;
  - re-add source registry/source matrix/API references intentionally rather
    than by partial rollback;
  - rerun unit tests, build, protected build, full managed e2e, production
    exposure scan, and production route smoke before release.

## 2026-09-02 18:46 +07:00 — Clear Remaining Local Map Research Data

- Request: remove all remaining historical data that feeds the local map,
  including the previously retained `2025-12` period, while keeping the then
  separate prediction fixtures intact.
- Checkpoint:
  `/tmp/codex-rollback-checkpoints/korattanphai-clear-remaining-map-data-20260902-184626/`
- Release status: verified locally before production deployment for the fully
  cleared local research map dataset.
- Will remove from live data:
  - all local research map periods from
    `normalized_research_monthly_panel.json`;
  - latest district/subdistrict research summaries, province monthly summaries,
    attention lists, conflict lists, and top rainfall rows from
    `normalized_research_panel_summary.json`.
- Will keep in the app:
  - the then separate drought forecast fixtures and point-in-time water snapshot
    data;
  - OPSMOAC prediction-readiness data and canonical nationwide month contracts;
  - Nakhon Ratchasima admin hierarchy, GeoJSON geometry, and map rendering
    components.
- Restore checklist:
  - restore the two normalized research JSON files from the checkpoint if the
    parked `2025-12` map dataset is needed for comparison or rollback;
  - rerun domain tests, typecheck, lint, build, e2e, and route smoke before
    release.

## 2026-09-02 12:19 +07:00 — Clear Historical Local Map Research Data

- Request: remove historical data that feeds the map/month selector before
  loading a new dataset, while keeping the then separate prediction fixtures
  intact.
- Checkpoint:
  `/tmp/codex-rollback-checkpoints/korattanphai-clear-historical-map-data-20260902-121928/`
- Release status: verified locally for the local research map dataset cleanup.
- Will remove from live data:
  - local research map periods before `2025-12` from
    `normalized_research_monthly_panel.json`;
  - historical province research summary rows before `2025-12` from
    `normalized_research_panel_summary.json`.
- Will keep in the app:
  - the latest local research map period, all 289 subdistrict records, district
    and subdistrict latest summaries;
  - the then separate prediction fixtures and point-in-time water snapshot data;
  - OPSMOAC prediction-readiness and canonical nationwide month contracts.
- Restore checklist:
  - restore the two normalized research JSON files from the checkpoint if the
    historical map periods are needed again;
  - rerun domain tests, typecheck, lint, build, and route smoke before release.

## 2026-08-31 22:43 +07:00 — Hide Technical Source Names From User-Facing Copy

- Request: remove end-user-facing references to the previous water-data provider
  and Excel-style source filenames while keeping the demo data and internal
  provenance records intact.
- Checkpoint: archived local checkpoint path from the 2026-08-31 copy-removal
  cleanup.
- Release status: parked for the Nakhon Ratchasima-only demo UX; restore only
  if source/file provenance needs to be exposed in the public UI again.
- Will remove from live UI:
  - source/file names in province drought forecast copy;
  - source/file names in district and subdistrict forecast remarks;
  - source/file names in data-limit accordions, fallback notices, and no-data
    explanations;
  - placeholder copy that exposed upstream water-data source acronyms.
- Will keep in the app:
  - canonical JSON, source registry, ingest lineage, internal TypeScript names,
    and documentation needed to preserve provenance;
  - forecast and historical data behavior, with only the visible copy changed.
- Restore checklist:
  - restore the visible source/file copy in the province, district, and
    subdistrict panels;
  - restore e2e expectations for the source-specific text;
  - rerun targeted route snapshots before release.

## 2026-08-31 21:42 +07:00 — Remove Visible Water UI From Korat Tan Phai

- Request: remove water/rain graphs and water-related evidence panels from the
  province overview, district, and subdistrict pages in the Nakhon
  Ratchasima-only Korat Tan Phai site.
- Checkpoint:
  `/tmp/codex-rollback-checkpoints/korattanphai-remove-visible-water-ui-20260831-214232/`
- Earlier scoped checkpoint:
  `/tmp/codex-rollback-checkpoints/korattanphai-remove-water-area-panels-20260831-214144/`
- Release status: intentionally parked for this Nakhon Ratchasima-only release
  per the current product direction; restore only if the water/rain surface is
  explicitly reopened later.
- Will remove from live UI:
  - province overview rainfall, water-level, forecast-rain, station coverage,
    water readiness, and official-water panels;
  - district/subdistrict forecast graph modules fed by the official rainfall
    snapshot then in use;
  - district/subdistrict rainfall history panels;
  - district/subdistrict rainfall station/readiness panels;
  - visible map-layer/filter affordances that expose rainfall or water-system
    views;
  - water-related helper docs/e2e expectations that treated those panels as
    visible page content.
- Will keep in the app:
  - district/subdistrict routes and map drill-down;
  - agricultural risk, drought, crop/context, and prediction readiness surfaces;
  - shared data/domain functions where water/rain evidence still supports
    province overview or prediction semantics.
- Restore checklist:
  - restore the parked UI calls in `ProvinceView`, `DistrictView`, and
    `SubdistrictView`;
  - restore area-page and overview e2e expectations for rainfall/water panels
    and layer options;
  - rerun unit, build, e2e, and route snapshots before release.

## 2026-08-31 21:19 +07:00 — Remove Province Water Page From Korat Tan Phai

- Request: remove the `/water` page and page-specific water code from the
  Nakhon Ratchasima-only Korat Tan Phai site.
- Checkpoint:
  `/tmp/codex-rollback-checkpoints/korattanphai-remove-water-page-20260831-211931/`
- Release status: intentionally parked for this Nakhon Ratchasima-only release
  per the current product direction; restore only if the water page is
  explicitly reopened later.
- Will remove from live routes:
  - the province-level `/water` route;
  - the visible `น้ำ` tab and tab-specific navigation target;
  - route/test/docs contracts that say `/water` is a primary surface.
- Will keep in the app:
  - rainfall/water-level evidence that still appeared as context in the
    province overview and forecast/readiness surfaces;
  - shared map layer and prediction semantics that still depend on water/rain
    evidence.
- Restore checklist:
  - restore route/tab contracts in `src/domain.ts` and
    `src/components/NakhonRatchasimaWorkspace.tsx`;
  - restore `/water` docs and e2e expectations;
  - rerun unit, build, e2e, and production smoke before release.

Previous Korat Tan Phai bootstrap note: the older item below is retained as
upstream provenance from the source project snapshot and is not part of the
current `/water` removal scope.

## 2026-08-30 17:22 +07:00 — Nakhon Ratchasima Mapping Cleanup

- Request: remove obsolete or confusing old code/data names that could make
  future work confuse local names with the province hierarchy.
- Checkpoint: `/tmp/codex-rollback-checkpoints/Kaset-Tan-Phai-20260830-172203/`
- Scope being cleaned from live source:
  - legacy `korat-*` layer IDs, class names, data attributes, tests, and source
    IDs owned by this project;
  - scattered app route checks now replaced by the route resolver in
    `src/domain.ts`;
  - stale docs suggesting legacy selectors or local nicknames are acceptable as
    province-level naming.
- Kept intentionally:
  - the real `ตำบลโคราช` administrative record under district code `3018`;
  - the official `koratpao.go.th` source URL because it is the publisher URL;
  - existing nationwide routes, workflows, source provenance classes, and the
    `TH-P29` canonical province object.
- Restore checklist:
  - apply `git-diff.patch` from the checkpoint if this cleanup needs to be
    reversed;
  - restore untracked source files from `untracked/`;
  - rerun `git diff --check`, `npm test`, `npm run build`, and route snapshots.

## 2026-09-20: Actual / Archive Split Accepted As Parked

The owner explicitly requested a new forward commit restoring the forecast-only
website, followed by push and deployment. No history rewrite or whole-commit
revert is authorized. `bcbcd33` is documentation; runtime activation originated
in `8357b02`, which also contains unrelated UI improvements that must remain.

Recovery checkpoint: `artifacts/rollback-forecast-only/` at HEAD `bcbcd33`.
It contains working/staged binary diffs, status, and copies of 17 untracked mobile
source/assets. Dependencies and credentials are excluded. Other untracked work
is untouched. The iOS setup is paused and excluded from this release.

Parked live behavior: Actual-by-default routing, valid-month conversion of legacy
forecast links, and the Actual/Archive switch/banner. Retain the operational
workspace, domain contracts, metadata API and unit tests as unmounted preparation,
not an activated actual feed. No database data, permissions or migrations change.

Active behavior: forecast overview and six-horizon province/district/tambon
workspaces; `target` is origin T, T+1 through T+6 are predictions. Preserve rev03
values, null/out-of-study semantics, freshness checks, graph/layout repairs,
shared searchable controls, exports and bookmarks. Explicit archive URLs remain
compatible. A retired `period` query never becomes a forecast origin.

Restoration of Actual later requires new owner approval and corrected requirements,
approved source/metric/publication contracts, adapter evidence and route/temporal
interaction tests. Do not reactivate it merely because parked files exist.

Release verification: forecast defaults and old links at overview/province,
district and tambon levels; month/horizon and history navigation; saved/search
context; no operational API dependency; missing-origin handling; protected build,
browser regressions and authenticated read-only candidate/production smoke.
Current release evidence is recorded in `docs/HANDOFF.md`.
