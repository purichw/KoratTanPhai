# Production Smoke

## Scope And Safety

The smoke harness uses a real admin-provisioned Supabase test account in fresh,
isolated Chromium contexts. Set `SMOKE_AUTH_EMAIL` and `SMOKE_AUTH_PASSWORD`
securely in the runner environment; missing values fail before network access.
It signs in/out and reads pages, assets and retained operational metadata. The
retired risk-fusion endpoint is not a smoke target. It never
edits application data, publishes advisories, resets demo state, changes account
settings or saves reusable browser credentials. Login affects Supabase auth
sessions/audit records but requires no application-data cleanup.

The target is restricted to localhost, the exact production origin, or preview
origins explicitly listed in `SMOKE_ALLOWED_PREVIEW_ORIGINS` after their project
ownership has been verified. A matching hostname prefix is not ownership proof.
Browser requests are limited to that origin, the known project Supabase origin,
and the two Google Fonts origins; cross-origin redirects cannot receive credentials.
Preview deployment protection must allow the runner; an access
denial is a failure, not evidence that the application passed. Do not disable
protection or add production credentials to source files to make the test pass.

For a protected candidate, the runner may receive `SMOKE_VERCEL_COOKIE` from
an authorized Vercel CLI session. Keep its `_vercel_jwt` value in process memory
only, never a file or CI artifact. The harness scopes it to the target host,
rejects localhost use and API redirects, and redacts it from failure reports.
This authenticates the runner to Vercel; Supabase login is still tested normally.

For database releases, set `SMOKE_DATA_BACKEND=supabase`. The harness compares
actual scoped app RPC projections to canonical source, checks the risk class of
every in-scope map polygon on all five routes and that other areas are filtered,
checks both chart units and source risk categories, rejects full-archive reads
and static archive fallback, and reads
the saved-workspace modal. `SMOKE_SAVED_FILTER_NAME` optionally verifies a known
saved record across fresh login sessions; the harness itself does not create
or delete personal records. Database-mode smoke also checks all three irrigation
groups by selecting the in-map dropdown: unchanged URL/history length,
categorical colors, canonical location codes, forecast counts and reload
persistence, plus a zero-match subdistrict/reset without false no-risk results.
It captures irrigation and
saved-filter desktop/mobile screenshots.
Run `scripts/verify-database-archive.mjs` separately with the real public Vite
configuration and smoke credentials for complete API/source and anonymous-access
verification. Both scripts redact credentials and keep sessions in memory.

## Run

```bash
npm run smoke
SMOKE_URL='https://korattanphai-<verified-deployment>.vercel.app' SMOKE_ALLOWED_PREVIEW_ORIGINS='https://korattanphai-<verified-deployment>.vercel.app' npm run smoke
```

Install the locked dependencies and Chromium first (`npm ci`,
`npx playwright install chromium`). For localhost, start a preview server on an
available port after `npm run build:protected`. The harness does not start or
deploy a server. Local Vite previews explicitly skip serverless API and hosting
header checks; deployed checks require them.

Checks cover login, overview, drought, district and subdistrict pages at 1440x960
and 390x844; forecast defaults on bare/retired-period links without operational API
reads; explicit archive compatibility; 289 map polygons; canonical RPC/color parity;
latest T+1 counts; synchronized page/map month controls; T+1/T+4 selection;
subdistrict status without aggregate charts; all-null districts without false
zero risk; irrigation/empty reset; percent/count graphs; Excel workbook values,
charts and PivotTables; saved-workspace reads; logout; images; overflow; console
and same-origin network errors; hosting/security/cache headers.
The retained operational-context endpoint is checked only as a parked metadata
contract, never as evidence of an active Actual product.

Reports and desktop/mobile screenshots are written to ignored `smoke-results/`.
Treat screenshots as private: they may contain the test account's display name.
Do not capture password fields, auth response bodies or token-bearing traces.
Set `SMOKE_OUTPUT_DIR` to a separate artifact directory when checks run concurrently.
The process exits nonzero on failure. A green smoke run describes that target
at that time; it does not prove that an unpushed local change is deployed.

## Admin Navigation

For Admin navigation changes, `node scripts/smoke-admin-navigation.mjs` uses the
same target, credential, protection-cookie and output-directory environment
variables. It checks desktop/mobile CMS destinations, draft-list reload, the
upload dialog and template download, plus independent visitor/Admin sessions.
It also inspects the real hierarchy resource: source-backed counts, visible
images/backgrounds, district/substring filtering, cross-page selected CSV,
dialog focus restoration, resource reload and History reachability. Resource
`get`/`history` POST requests are explicitly read-only allowlisted; write
operations remain blocked. Detail full-page/viewport captures and geometry
are included in the report for both widths.
It blocks application writes and never uploads or creates a production draft.
Local `e2e/admin-navigation.spec.ts` covers unsaved-file/history/discard behavior
against the isolated database; the real-account check stays read-only.

Set `SMOKE_CMS_LIFECYCLE=1` for current lifecycle verification. This additionally
allowlists the read-only `forecast-readiness`, `forecast-history` and `work-list`
POST actions, and checks readiness/new-round/recovery dialogs and saved work.
It does not create a draft, upload a file, autosave or publish live data. Exercise
those writes against the isolated fixtures as described in
[CMS_FORECAST_LIFECYCLE](CMS_FORECAST_LIFECYCLE.md).

## Illustrated loading checks

For loading changes, cover pre-JS, pending authenticated entry and ready/error
release on Visitor/Admin at representative desktop/mobile sizes. Hold then
continue actual reads unchanged when verifying a hosted target; fixtures belong
in local E2E. Verify real 0/33/67/100 milestones, no timed progress, continuous
normal-motion orbit, reduced-motion feedback and non-blocking completion.
Inspect decoded landscape/portrait artwork, emblem, orbit SVG, overflow and
asset identity. Cached routes may legitimately skip already-completed steps.

Maintained regression owners are `e2e/startup-loading.spec.ts`,
`e2e/page-loading.spec.ts`, `e2e/forecast-loading.spec.ts` and
`tests/pageLoadBoundary.test.tsx`. The November hosted capture helper was local
tooling, not a tracked npm command. Exact hosted evidence and its limits live in
[LOADING_SCREEN](LOADING_SCREEN.md); do not assume a gitignored helper exists in
a fresh checkout or claim physical-device FPS from browser screenshots.

## Mobile Map Labels

For map-name visibility changes, `node scripts/smoke-map-labels.mjs` uses the
same authenticated target, preview allow-list and protected-cookie environment
variables as the other hosted checks. It blocks application writes and loads
real CMS geometry and forecast slices without mocks.

The check covers province zoom, unselected tambon labels after a two-finger
mobile pinch, district scope and a selected tambon on desktop/mobile. It measures
font sizes after both SVG and camera transforms, verifies the 289 named map
polygons and route-specific forecast coverage, and captures contextual map and
viewport screenshots. Full geometry, source and label metrics are saved in
`SMOKE_OUTPUT_DIR/report.json`; stdout prints a compact summary. Use a fresh
output directory for candidate and production checks and inspect the images.

## CI

`quality.yml` runs unit/data tests, the protected build, exposure/bundle checks,
generated-data drift checks and desktop/mobile E2E against `dist` on pushes/PRs.
It builds with a fake Supabase URL/key and intercepts auth in Playwright; no
real Supabase request or production auth bypass is used. Failure traces contain
only fake test credentials and are retained for seven days. It does not deploy.

`deployment-smoke.yml` runs on successful Production deployment-status events
and also supports a manually supplied URL. It uploads smoke evidence for seven
days. These workflows must be pushed before GitHub can execute them; automatic
post-deploy execution also requires the hosting integration to emit GitHub
deployment-status events. CLI-only deploys without those events require the
manual workflow or local smoke command.

The deployment workflow also requires repository secrets `SMOKE_AUTH_EMAIL` and
`SMOKE_AUTH_PASSWORD` for a limited test account. They are not provisioned by
the auth implementation. Do not substitute fake E2E credentials or weaken
Supabase settings to make this check pass. See `AUTH_SETUP.md`.

When another task is building in the same checkout, use an isolated artifact and
test-output directory so one run cannot overwrite another's evidence:

```bash
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://ktp-auth-test.supabase.co VITE_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=sb_publishable_test_only BUILD_OUT_DIR=tmp-snapshots/verification-build npm run build:protected
BUILD_OUT_DIR=tmp-snapshots/verification-build npm run test:e2e:built -- --output=tmp-snapshots/verification-tests
```

Repository branch protections and Vercel deployment blocking are not configured
by these files. Require the `regression` check in repository protection rules
before calling CI a mandatory merge/release blocker. The configuration follows
the official [GitHub deployment event documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/workflows-and-actions/events-that-trigger-workflows#deployment_status)
and [GitHub setup-node action](https://github.com/actions/setup-node).
